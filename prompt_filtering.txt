The robot is operating in the following environment: **{scene_description}**

The goal of the robot is to complete the following task: **{task_instruction}**

### **Your Objectives**
The provided reasoning responses in **{reasoning_prompt}** contain inconsistencies in how the task, plan, and reasoning elements are described. Your goal is to generate a **consistent** version by enforcing the following constraints:

---

## **1. Define a Fixed Task and Plan**
From the given **task instruction** and **inconsistent reasoning**, extract and define a **consistent** version of:
- **`<task>`**: A fixed and uniform description of the task that remains unchanged across all steps.
- **`<plan>`**: A structured, ordered list of high-level steps that the robot follows to complete the task.

**Consistency Rules:**
- **`<task>` must be identical** at every step.
- **`<plan>` must remain fixed** and include all necessary subgoals to complete the task.
- **`<subtask>` must always be selected from `<plan>`**—no deviations.

---

## **2. Generate a Step-by-Step Reasoning Dictionary**
For each step, generate a reasoning entry in the following structured format:

<step_id>: "<reasoning>"

Where `<reasoning>` follows this strict format:

1. **`<task></task>`**: The same fixed task for all steps.
2. **`<plan></plan>`**: The same fixed ordered list of high-level movements.
3. **`<subtask></subtask>`**: Select a subtask **exclusively from `<plan>`**.
4. **`<subtask_reason></subtask_reason>`**: Justify the selection of the subtask in a **consistent manner** across all steps.
5. **`<move></move>`**: Describe the primitive movement at this step.
6. **`<move_reason></move_reason>`**: Provide a justification for the movement, using **uniform phrasing** throughout all steps.

**Additional Consistency Requirements:**
- **Ensure `<task>` and `<plan>` remain constant** across all steps.
- **Use standardized language in `<move_reason>`**—avoid variations in verbs and phrasing.
- **Maintain logical coherence between steps**—each reasoning should naturally follow from the previous steps.

---

## **Summary of Required Output**
1. **Consistent Task Definition**
   - A **fixed** `<task>` description.
   - A **fixed, ordered** `<plan>`.

2. **Step-by-Step Reasoning Dictionary**
   - A Python dictionary formatted within triple backticks (` ```python `).
   - Each step’s reasoning must strictly follow the **fixed** `<task>` and `<plan>`.
   - No inconsistencies, contradictions, or redundant variations.

3. **FINISHED Label**
   - Write `"FINISHED"` on a new line at the end of the response.
