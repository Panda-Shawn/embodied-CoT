Annotate the training trajectory with reasoning

## Overview

You are an expert reinforcement learning researcher who has trained a robotic arm to complete a given task. The robot followed an optimal policy and successfully accomplished the instruction: "{task_instruction}". During the task, the robot executed a sequence of actions, and each action corresponds to a step along the trajectory. For each step, the primitive movement is provided.

Your goal is to annotate each step of the completed trajectory with detailed reasoning. This reasoning should incorporate the robot’s intermediate objectives, the observed environment, and the decision-making process behind choosing each action.

## Experimental Setup

+ Task Instruction: "{task_instruction}"

+ Primitive movements:

The primitive movements the robot take is described by the following dictionary:

```python
{primitives_prompt}
```

Each key in this dictionary represents a step index, and the value is the set of features describing the action the robot is about to take at that step.

+ Environment Description:

The robot is operating in the following environment: {scene_description}

## Your Objectives

1. Provide a comprehensive task overview

First, describe the completed task in detail. Go beyond simply restating the given instruction. Include:

+ The primary activity and the intended outcome.
+ The objects involved and their relative locations in the environment.
+ The general sequence of high-level movements that were necessary to achieve the goal.

From this description, identify the high-level movements that form the plan the robot likely followed. For each high-level movement, specify:

+ The range of trajectory steps that it spans.
+ A justification of why that high-level movement was needed.

Present this overview in markdown format, using natural language and ensuring that the explanation is consistent with the completed trajectory as described in the provided features.

2. Annotate each step with reasoning:

For each step in the provided trajectory, generate a detailed reasoning entry that explains:

+ The remaining part of the task that needs to be completed at this step.
+ The current progress and what still needs to be done.
+ The objects and aspects of the environment that are still relevant.
+ The next steps in the plan and why the specific primitive movement at this step is the correct choice.

You should start from the high-level understanding of the plan and then become more specific, integrating the environmental and state features that justify each individual action.

**Format for Each Step’s Reasoning:**

The reasoning for each step should be provided as a single string and must follow the template below. Wrap the entire set of step reasonings in a Python dictionary. The keys of this dictionary must match the step keys from the original trajectory, and there must be a one-to-one correspondence (one reasoning entry per step).

For each step <step_id>, create an entry in the dictionary:

```python
<step_id>: "<reasoning>"
```

Within the <reasoning> string, include the following tags and contents in order:

+ <task></task>: Describe the remaining part of the overall task. If no task remains (i.e., at the end), write <task>Stop.</task>.
+ <plan></plan>: Outline the remaining high-level plan using a numbered list “1. 2. 3.” etc. If no plan remains, write <plan>1. Stop.</plan>
+ <subtask></subtask>: Identify the current high-level subtask that should be done right now. If none remains, write <subtask>Stop.</subtask>.
+ <subtask_reason></subtask_reason>: Justify why this subtask should be executed now, considering the current environment and progress.
+ <move></move>: Describe the exact primitive movement the robotic arm will take at this step.
+ <move_reason></move_reason>: Justify why this particular primitive movement is the correct choice right now, based on the observed features and the overall plan.

Make sure each reasoning string is detailed, precise, and consistent with both the completed task and the provided trajectory features.

## Summary of Required Output

1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

+ A detailed overview of the completed task.
+ A description of the identified high-level movements, their step ranges, and the justifications for each.

2. Step-by-Step Reasoning Dictionary

+ A Python dictionary whose keys correspond exactly to the step indices found in the trajectory features. Make sure the dictionary is wrapped within ```python```.
+ Each value is a single reasoning string, following the specified tagging format.

3. FINISHED Label

+ After providing all required output, write a single label FINISHED on its own line to indicate that you have completed the instructions.
