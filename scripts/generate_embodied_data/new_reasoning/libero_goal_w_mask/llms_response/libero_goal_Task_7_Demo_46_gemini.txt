## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The intended outcome is to have the stove's knob in the "on" position.  The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially the stove knob itself. Other objects on the table (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate) are irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** The robot needs to move to a position where its arm can reach the stove knob.  This likely spans steps 0-4.

2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot must reach and grasp the stove knob using its gripper.  This encompasses steps 5-6.

3. **Turn the knob:** The robot rotates the knob clockwise to turn the stove on. This corresponds to steps 8-12.

4. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the stove after successfully turning it on. This is implied by step 7.
