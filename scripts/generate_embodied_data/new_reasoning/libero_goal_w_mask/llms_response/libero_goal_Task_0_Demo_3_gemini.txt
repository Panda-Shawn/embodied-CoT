## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing various objects: a stove adjacent to the cabinet, a wine rack and bottle, a plate, cream cheese, and an Akita bowl on a table or wooden floor. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and open it. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:**  This involved navigating the robot to a position in front of the cabinet. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Position the arm for drawer access:** This phase focused on precisely orienting the robot arm to accurately target the middle drawer handle. (Steps 3-7)
3. **Open the drawer:**  This involved executing the action of pulling open the middle drawer. (Steps 8-9)
4. **Stop:** The robot then stopped its actions. (Step 10-12)
