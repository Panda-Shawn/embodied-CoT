## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a plate located on a table to the front of a stove, also on the table.  The environment includes several other objects: a wooden cabinet (to the right), a wine rack (behind the stove), a wine bottle (on the table), cream cheese (to the left of the plate), and an Akita black bowl (on the table). The primary activity is pushing the plate; the intended outcome is the plate's position directly in front of the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the plate:** The robot needs to position itself appropriately to interact with the plate. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp and push the plate:** The robot needs to make contact with the plate and apply sufficient force to push it. (Steps 3-10)
3. **Move to final position:** The robot needs to adjust its position to ensure the plate is positioned correctly in front of the stove. (Steps 11)
