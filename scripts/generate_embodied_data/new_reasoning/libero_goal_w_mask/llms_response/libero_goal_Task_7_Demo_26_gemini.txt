## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove located on the left side of a table. The environment included a stove, a wooden cabinet on the right side of the table, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle, a cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate all on the table. The primary activity was manipulating the stove's controls to turn it on. The intended outcome was a functional stove, indicated by the visual or other sensory feedback confirming its activation (though this feedback isn't explicitly provided in the problem description).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 1-4)  The robot needed to navigate to the stove, avoiding obstacles such as the cabinet and other items on the table. This involved a series of movements to position itself optimally for interaction with the stove's controls.

2. **Reach and grasp the stove knob:** (Steps 4-9)  After positioning itself appropriately, the robot needed to extend its arm, locate the stove knob, and securely grasp it with its gripper.  This phase involved precise movements to align the gripper with the knob.

3. **Turn the stove knob:** (Steps 11) Once the knob was grasped, the robot needed to rotate it to the "on" position.

4. **Retract and stop:** (Steps 10, 12) After turning the knob, the robot needed to retract its arm and stop to complete the task.
