## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a container of cream cheese from its resting position to a bowl.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the cream cheese container, and the intended outcome was its safe and complete transfer into the bowl.  The objects involved were a bowl (containing cream cheese), a cream cheese container, and a wooden table or floor. The bowl with cream cheese was in the center of the table, while the specific location of the cream cheese container is not explicitly stated but implied by the trajectory. The general sequence of high-level movements included: approaching the cream cheese container, grasping the cream cheese container, lifting the cream cheese container, moving to the bowl, and depositing the cream cheese container into the bowl.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-6.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm within reach of the cream cheese container. The robot needs to navigate around other objects on the table to get close enough to the container without colliding.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6.  This involved the closing of the gripper to secure the container. This is crucial for successfully lifting and moving the container.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** Steps 9-13. The robot lifts the cream cheese container and moves towards the bowl, adjusting its position and orientation for the next movement.


4. **Deposit Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-17. This involves positioning the container above the bowl and releasing it. Accurate positioning is critical to avoid spills or dropping the container.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 18-21.  The robot moves away from the bowl to prevent accidental knocking over of the bowl.
