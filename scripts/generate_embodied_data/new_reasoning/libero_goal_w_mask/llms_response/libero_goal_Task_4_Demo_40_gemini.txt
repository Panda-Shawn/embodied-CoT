## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl, located on the left side of a table alongside a cream cheese, wine bottle, and flat stove, to the top of a wooden cabinet situated on the right side of the table.  Other objects on the table include a plate and a wine rack. The primary activity is manipulation: picking up the bowl and placing it on the cabinet. The intended outcome is the bowl being successfully placed on top of the cabinet.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed is:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl (Steps 0-3):** The robot needs to move to the bowl's location and grasp it securely.
2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl (Steps 4-7):**  The robot must lift the bowl, clearing any obstacles, and move it toward the cabinet.
3. **Position and Place the Bowl (Steps 8-11):** The robot needs to carefully position the bowl on top of the cabinet.
4. **Retract and Stop (Steps 12-15):** The robot retracts its arm and stops the operation.


| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and Grasp the Bowl     | 0-3         | The robot needs to reach the bowl and secure a firm grip before attempting to lift it.                              |
| Lift and Transport the Bowl     | 4-7         | The robot needs to lift the bowl and move it to the cabinet, avoiding collisions with other objects.               |
| Position and Place the Bowl     | 8-11        | The robot must position the bowl carefully on the cabinet to ensure stability.                                  |
| Retract and Stop                | 12-15       | The robot needs to safely retract its arm after successfully placing the bowl and terminate the action sequence. |
