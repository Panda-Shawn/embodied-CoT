## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a container of cream cheese from its current location to a silver bowl.  The cream cheese is assumed to be on a small white plate located on a table. The silver bowl is situated next to the plate. Other objects present in the environment—a bottle of wine, wooden cabinet, flat stove, and wine rack—are irrelevant to the task.  The primary activity is the transference of the cream cheese. The intended outcome is the cream cheese resting inside the silver bowl.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the plate:** The robot needs to move into position to grasp the cream cheese. (Steps 1-4)
2. **Grasp the cream cheese:** The robot extends its gripper to pick up the cream cheese. (Steps 5-9)
3. **Lift and transport to the bowl:**  The robot lifts the cream cheese and moves it to the bowl. (Steps 11-14)
4. **Place the cream cheese in the bowl:** The robot releases the cream cheese into the bowl. (Steps 15-18)
5. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the bowl. (Steps 19-20)
