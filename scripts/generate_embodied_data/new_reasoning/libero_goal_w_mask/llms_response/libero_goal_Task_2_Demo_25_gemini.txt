## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a table among other objects (cream cheese, bowl, plate, wooden cabinet, flat stove, and wine rack), to the top of a wooden cabinet, also situated on the table.  The primary activity is manipulation and relocation of the wine bottle. The intended outcome is the wine bottle resting securely on top of the cabinet.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal involves:

1. **Approaching the wine bottle:** The robot needs to navigate to the location of the wine bottle on the table.  This involves a series of movements to position itself appropriately for grasping.
2. **Grasping the wine bottle:** The robot must carefully grasp the wine bottle using its gripper, ensuring a stable hold.
3. **Lifting and transporting the wine bottle:**  The robot lifts the bottle and moves it to the desired location on top of the cabinet.
4. **Placing the wine bottle:** The robot carefully places the bottle onto the cabinet, releasing its grip to complete the task.


High-Level Movements and their corresponding step ranges:

1. **Approaching the wine bottle (steps 0-5):**  The robot lowers itself to the appropriate height and moves towards the wine bottle. This is necessary to position the robot's arm for grasping the bottle.
2. **Grasping the wine bottle (steps 6-8):** The robot moves to a position directly above the wine bottle and closes its gripper to secure a grasp.
3. **Lifting and transporting the wine bottle (steps 9-16):** The robot lifts the wine bottle, moves it to a position above the cabinet, and adjusts its orientation to prepare for placement.
4. **Placing the wine bottle (steps 17-20):** The robot positions the bottle on the cabinet and releases its grip.
5. **Completion (step 21):** The robot concludes the task.
