## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove.  The stove is located on the left side of a table.  The environment also contains a wooden cabinet (right side of the table), a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, cream cheese (left side of the table), a plate, and an Akita black bowl (on the table). The robot needs to reach the stove's controls (presumably a knob or switch) to turn it on. The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the stove, positioning the arm to reach the controls, and finally manipulating the controls to turn the stove on.


Based on the trajectory, the robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-3. The robot needs to navigate around other objects on the table to get into a position where it can reach the stove.

2. **Position arm for interaction:** Steps 4-6. The robot refines its position to accurately reach the stoveâ€™s controls, potentially accounting for the stove's height and orientation.  This includes closing its gripper to potentially interact with the control knob.

3. **Turn on the stove:** Steps 8. The robot engages with the stove's controls to turn it on.
