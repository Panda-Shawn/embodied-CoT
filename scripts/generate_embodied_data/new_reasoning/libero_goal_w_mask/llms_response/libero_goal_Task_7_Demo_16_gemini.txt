## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to turn on a stove located on a table.  The environment included a stove on the left side of the table, a wooden cabinet on the right, and various other objects (wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, plate) which were irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was to locate the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome was a functional stove, ready for use.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-2. This involved moving the robotic arm closer to the stove to reach the control knob.  Justification: The arm needed to be in a position to interact with the stove.

2. **Grasp the control knob:** Steps 3-6. This involved positioning the arm above the knob and closing the gripper to secure the knob. Justification:  The robot needed to have control of the knob to rotate it.

3. **Rotate the knob:** Steps 8-10. This involved rotating the knob to turn on the stove.  Justification: This is the crucial action to achieve the task's primary goal.

4. **Release the knob:** Steps 11-13. This involved opening the gripper to release the control knob. Justification: The robot no longer needs to interact with the knob after turning it on.

5. **Return to rest position:** Steps 14. This involved moving to a safe neutral position. Justification: This is a standard safety procedure after task completion.
