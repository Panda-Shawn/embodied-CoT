## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in a kitchen-like environment. The cabinet is situated next to a stove.  Other objects present include a wine rack and bottle, a plate, a cream cheese, and an Akita black bowl, all on a table or wooden floor. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needed to navigate to a position in front of the cabinet to be able to interact with it. This involved moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the cabinet.

2. **Position arm for drawer interaction:** (Steps 4-8) The robot needed to precisely position its end effector (gripper or similar) above the middle drawer handle. This included moving laterally (to the right), tilting down and further adjustment of its orientation.

3. **Open the drawer:** (Steps 9-10) The robot would use the positioned end effector to exert downward force on the drawer handle, opening the drawer.

4. **Retreat slightly:** (Steps 11-15) Once the drawer was open, the robot retreated to a safe distance and stopped.
