## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a robotic arm to open the top drawer of a cabinet and place a bowl inside. The environment contains a cabinet with a drawer, a bowl located on a table near the cabinet, and other objects (wine rack, cream cheese, wine bottle, plate, stove) that are irrelevant to the task.  The primary activity is manipulation: grasping the bowl, moving it to the cabinet, opening the drawer, and placing the bowl inside. The intended outcome is a bowl successfully placed inside the open top drawer of the cabinet.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the bowl:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself to reach the bowl. This involves moving closer to the bowl on the table.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** (Steps 5-16) The robot must reach the bowl, grasp it securely with its gripper.

3. **Move to the drawer:** (Steps 17-20)  The robot needs to move the grasped bowl to the location of the cabinet drawer.

4. **Open the drawer and place the bowl:** (Steps 21-26) The robot must open the drawer and carefully deposit the bowl inside, and then retract.
