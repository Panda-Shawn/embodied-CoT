## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to move a wine bottle from its current location on a table to a wine rack located to its right.  The environment included a wine bottle, a wine rack (to the right of the bottle), a wooden cabinet (to the right of the rack), a cream cheese (to the left of a plate), a bowl (to the left of the wine bottle), and a flat stove (to the left of the wine rack).  All items are on a wooden surface.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle (Steps 0-12):**  The robot needed to maneuver around other objects (bowl, potentially the stove) to reach the bottle and position itself for grasping.  This involved adjustments in orientation and position to ensure a stable grip.

2. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle (Steps 13-15):** Once the bottle was grasped, the robot lifted it and moved it towards the wine rack, avoiding obstacles.

3. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack (Steps 16-19):** The robot precisely positioned the bottle on the rack, potentially requiring adjustments to its orientation.

4. **Release the Wine Bottle and Finish (Steps 20-21):** Finally, the robot released its grip on the bottle, completing the task.
