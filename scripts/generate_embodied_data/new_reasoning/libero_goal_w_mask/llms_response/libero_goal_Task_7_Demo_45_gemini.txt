## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove. The stove is located on the left side of a table.  Other objects present on the table include a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, a plate with cream cheese, and an Akita black bowl. A wooden cabinet is on the right side of the table. The robot needs to reach the stove's control knob, likely located on the front or top of the stove, and rotate it to the "on" position.  The robot arm uses a gripper to interact with the knob.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are as follows:


1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the stove's control knob. This involves maneuvering around potential obstacles on the table.

2. **Grasp the stove knob:** (Steps 4-6)  Once positioned near the stove, the robot must accurately grasp the control knob using its gripper.

3. **Turn on the stove:** (Steps 8-8)  The robot needs to rotate the knob to turn the stove on.

4. **Release and retract:** (Steps 10-10) This involves releasing the knob and moving the arm away from the stove.
