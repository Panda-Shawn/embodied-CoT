## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the top drawer of a cabinet and place a bowl inside. The environment contains a cabinet with a drawer, a bowl, and other objects (wine rack, cream cheese, plate, wine bottle, flat stove) on a table. The bowl is located on the table, near the cabinet.  The primary activity is manipulating the robot arm to achieve this goal. The intended outcome is the bowl being successfully placed inside the opened top drawer of the cabinet.


The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves positioning the robot arm to be close enough to interact with the cabinet drawer.  (Steps 0-4)
2. **Open the drawer:** This involves extending the arm, grasping the drawer handle (or activating a mechanism to open the drawer), and pulling the drawer open. (Steps 5-16)
3. **Approach the bowl:** The robot arm needs to maneuver to reach the bowl on the table. (Steps 17-20)
4. **Grasp the bowl:** The gripper needs to securely grasp the bowl to lift and move it. (Steps 20)
5. **Move the bowl to the drawer:** The robot needs to transport the bowl from its location on the table to the open drawer. (Steps 21-26)
6. **Place the bowl in the drawer:** The robot should carefully place the bowl inside the drawer and release its grip. (Steps 27-31)
7. **Retreat:** The robot arm moves away from the cabinet after completing the task. (Steps 32)
