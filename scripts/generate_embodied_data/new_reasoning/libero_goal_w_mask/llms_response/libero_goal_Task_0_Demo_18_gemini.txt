## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack next to a wine bottle, a plate, cream cheese, an Akita black bowl, and a flat stove, all on a table or wooden floor.  The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed is:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** The robot needs to navigate the environment to position itself in front of the cabinet.  This involves avoiding obstacles and reaching a suitable distance and orientation for interaction.  (Steps 0-4)

2. **Locate and target the middle drawer:** The robot needs to visually identify the middle drawer among the other drawers on the cabinet.  This requires appropriate positioning and orientation of the robotic arm to accurately interact with the drawer handle or latch. (Steps 5-7)

3. **Open the drawer:** Once the drawer is targeted, the robot needs to execute the appropriate actions to open the drawer. This involves applying the correct force and direction to the drawer handle or latch. (Steps 8-11)

4. **Final Positioning and Stop:** The robot needs to stop at a position to signal task completion (steps 12-14).
