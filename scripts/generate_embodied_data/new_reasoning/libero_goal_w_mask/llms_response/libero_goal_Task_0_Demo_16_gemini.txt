## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in a cluttered environment.  The environment contained a wooden cabinet (right side), a wine rack (left side), cream cheese (middle), a wine bottle (next to the cream cheese), a plate (right side), a bowl (left side), and a flat stove. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the cabinet            | 0-8        | The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet's vicinity to reach the drawer.  Initial movement and orientation adjustments are necessary.                                                          |
| Locate and reach the drawer     | 9-15       |  Once near the cabinet, the robot must precisely position itself to interact with the drawer handle. This includes vertical and horizontal adjustments. |
| Open the drawer                 | 16-26      | This involves grasping and pulling the drawer handle.                                                  |
| Retract and finalize the action | 27-28      | The robot needs to pull back slightly to prevent interference and indicate the task is complete.     |
