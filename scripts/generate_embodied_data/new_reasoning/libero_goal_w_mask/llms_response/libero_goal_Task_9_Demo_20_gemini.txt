## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its location on a table to a wine rack.  The wine bottle, a plate, and a bowl are situated on the table. A wooden cabinet and a flat stove are on the floor.  The wine rack is also present in the environment, its exact location unspecified but assumed to be reachable by the robotic arm.

The robot needs to perform several high-level movements to complete the task:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle (Steps 0-9):** This involves positioning the robotic arm appropriately to grasp the bottle.  This is necessary to pick up the wine bottle before it can be placed on the rack.

2. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle (Steps 10-16):**  This stage involves lifting the grasped bottle and moving it towards the wine rack.  This is needed to move the bottle from its initial position to the desired location.

3. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack (Steps 17-19):**  This involves precisely positioning the bottle on the rack and releasing it. This is the final stage of the task, placing the bottle in its target location.

4. **Final Stop (Steps 20):**  This involves ending the task and stopping the arm. This step is necessary to complete the task formally.
