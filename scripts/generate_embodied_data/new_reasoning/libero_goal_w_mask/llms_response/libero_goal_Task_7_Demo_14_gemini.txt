## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove. The environment contains a stove on the left side of a table, various other objects (cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, Akita black bowl) are present but irrelevant to the task.  The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a lit stove.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needs to navigate to a position where its arm can reach the stove's control knob.
2. **Grasping the knob:**  The robot needs to position its gripper around the stove knob and securely grasp it.
3. **Rotating the knob:** The robot needs to rotate the knob to the "on" position.
4. **Retreating:** The robot needs to move its arm away from the stove.


High-level movement breakdown:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approaching the stove | 0-3 | The robot needs to move its arm to a position from which it can reach the stove's control knob. The initial position is assumed to be far from the stove. |
| Grasping the knob | 4-6 | The robot needs to be close enough to the knob to grasp it. This involves careful maneuvering to avoid colliding with other objects and to accurately position the gripper. |
| Rotating the knob | 9-13 |  The robot grasps the knob and rotates it to turn on the stove.  The movement involves several small adjustments. |
| Retreating | 7-8 |  After turning on the stove, the robot moves its arm away to avoid interference or accidental damage. |
