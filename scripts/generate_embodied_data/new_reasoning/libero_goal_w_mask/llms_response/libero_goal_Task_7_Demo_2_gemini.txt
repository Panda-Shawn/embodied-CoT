## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls (assuming it has a rotary knob or switch). The intended outcome is that the stove is turned on, indicated by a visual or auditory cue (e.g., a light illuminating or a clicking sound). The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of the table), and potentially the stove's control knob. Other objects in the environment (cabinet, wine rack, etc.) are irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:**  This involves navigating the robot arm to a position where it can reach the stove's controls. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the control knob:**  This requires moving the arm to precisely grasp the knob of the stove. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Turn on the stove:** This entails rotating the control knob to the "on" position. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Retract arm:** This is implied to complete the task (Step 11)
