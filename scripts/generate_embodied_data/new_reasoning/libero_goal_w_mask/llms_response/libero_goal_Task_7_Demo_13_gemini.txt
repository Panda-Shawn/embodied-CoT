## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove.  The environment contains a wooden cabinet with various items (cream cheese, wine rack), a wine bottle, a plate, and an Akita black bowl on a wooden floor or table. The stove's location is not explicitly stated, but we can infer it's somewhere within reach of the robot arm, based on the successful completion of the task. The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls to switch it on. The intended outcome is a lit stove burner.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needs to position itself appropriately to interact with the stove controls. This involves navigating around obstacles and reaching the stove's location.

2. **Grasp the stove knob:** (Steps 5-8) The robot must grip the stove knob to be able to rotate it and turn the stove on.

3. **Turn on the stove:** (Steps 10-12) Once grasped, the robot needs to rotate the knob to the "on" position.
