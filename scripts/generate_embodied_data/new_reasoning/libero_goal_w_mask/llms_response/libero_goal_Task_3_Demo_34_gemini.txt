## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bowl from a table and placing it inside the top drawer of a nearby cabinet.  The environment contained a wooden cabinet with a top drawer, a bowl, and other objects (wine rack, cream cheese, plate, wine bottle, flat stove) on a table near the cabinet. The primary activity was manipulation, aiming to move the bowl from its initial resting place on the table into the open top drawer of the cabinet. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the bowl within the drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement         | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the cabinet        | 0-2         | Position the robot arm near the cabinet to begin the task.                     |
| Open the top drawer         | 3-16        | Access the interior of the drawer to place the bowl.                         |
| Grasp the bowl              | 17-22       | Secure the bowl for transport.                                                |
| Move the bowl to the drawer | 23-29       | Transport the grasped bowl to the open drawer.                                |
| Place the bowl in the drawer | 30-34       | Carefully deposit the bowl into the drawer.                                  |
| Withdraw and stop          | 35          | Complete the task and return to a safe resting position.                       |
