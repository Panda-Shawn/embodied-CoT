## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located on the right side of a room.  The cabinet is situated amongst other objects including a wine rack (left), cream cheese (middle), wine bottle (near cream cheese), plate (right), and bowl (left), all on a wooden surface. The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to move towards the cabinet, which is on the right side of the environment.  This involves initial forward movement and minor adjustments in orientation to correctly approach the cabinet.

2. **Position Arm for Drawer Interaction:** (Steps 5-11)  The robot needs to position its arm above the middle drawer. This requires further adjustment of its position and orientation, possibly accounting for any obstacles.

3. **Open the Drawer:** (Steps 12-15) The robot executes the action of opening the drawer.  This involves a series of movements to grasp and manipulate the drawer handle.

4. **Retreat:** (Step 16) The robot moves slightly to the left, presumably to avoid obstructing the opened drawer.
