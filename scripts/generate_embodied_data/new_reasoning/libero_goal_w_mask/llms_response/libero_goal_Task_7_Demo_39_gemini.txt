## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on a stove.  The primary activity was to manipulate the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome was a functional stove, indicated by its operational status.  The objects involved were the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and implicitly, the stove's controls (assumed to be a knob or switch).  Other objects in the environment (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, and Akita black bowl) were irrelevant to the task. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needed to navigate to the stove's location.
2. **Positioning the arm:** The robot had to position its gripper above the stove's controls.
3. **Grasping the controls:** The robot needed to grasp the stove's controls to manipulate them.
4. **Turning on the stove:** The robot then turned the control to the 'on' position.
5. **Releasing the controls:** The robot released its grasp on the controls.

High-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:

| High-Level Movement        | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the stove      | 1-4        | To get close enough to interact with the stove controls.                         |
| Positioning the arm        | 5-6        | To accurately reach and grasp the stove controls.                               |
| Grasping the controls      | 5-7        | To establish control over the stove's on/off mechanism.                         |
| Turning on the stove       | 9-13       | To activate the stove. The rotation and tilting suggest knob manipulation.      |
| Releasing the controls    | 8, 13       | To complete the interaction and avoid any interference after turning on the stove.|
