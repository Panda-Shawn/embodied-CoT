## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bowl from the floor and placing it inside the top drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The cabinet is located near a wine rack. Other objects present in the environment include a cream cheese (on the cabinet), a wine bottle (location unspecified but irrelevant to the task), a plate (on the floor), and a flat stove (on the floor). The bowl is also on the floor.

The robot's primary activity was manipulation of the bowl. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the bowl inside the top drawer of the cabinet.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement        | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the bowl          | 0-5         | To reach the bowl, which is on the floor.                                        |
| Grasp the bowl            | 6-16        | To pick up the bowl in order to be able to move it.                            |
| Move to the cabinet       | 17-20       | To reach the target location â€“ the top drawer of the cabinet.                       |
| Open the drawer and place the bowl | 21-26      | To successfully complete the task as specified in the instruction.                 |
