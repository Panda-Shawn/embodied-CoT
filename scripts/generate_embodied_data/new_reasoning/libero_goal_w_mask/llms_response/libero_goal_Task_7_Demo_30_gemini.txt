1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The stove is located on the left side of a table.  The robot needs to reach the stove's control knob, likely located on the front or top of the stove, and rotate it to the "on" position.  Other objects on the table—a cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate—are irrelevant to the task, but their positions affect the robot's path planning to avoid collisions.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot's arm to a position near the stove's control knob, avoiding obstacles. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the control knob:** This involves moving the robotic arm's gripper to a position where it can securely grasp the control knob. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Turn on the stove:** This involves rotating the control knob clockwise to activate the stove. (Step 8)
4. **Stop:** The robot completes the task. (Step 7)
