## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The cabinet is situated in an environment containing a wine rack (next to the cabinet), a wine bottle (next to the wine rack), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), a cream cheese, and a flat stove, all on a wooden floor or table.  The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet, overcoming obstacles and orienting itself for interaction.

2. **Locate the middle drawer:** (Steps 4-6)  Once near the cabinet, the robot must precisely position itself to access the drawer handle.

3. **Open the drawer:** (Steps 7-9)  This involves gripping and pulling the drawer handle.

4. **Stop:** (Steps 10-12) The robot stops after completing the task.
