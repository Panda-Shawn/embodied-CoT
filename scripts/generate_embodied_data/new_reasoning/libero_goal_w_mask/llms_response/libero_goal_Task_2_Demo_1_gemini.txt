## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a table amongst other objects (a plate, a bowl, a wine rack), to the top of a wooden cabinet situated near a wine rack and a stove.  The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation. The intended outcome is the wine bottle resting securely on top of the cabinet.  The general sequence involves: approaching the bottle, grasping it, lifting it, transporting it to the cabinet, and placing it carefully on top.

High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bottle:** Steps 0-8.  This movement is necessary to get the robotic arm into a position to pick up the bottle.  It involves maneuvering around other objects on the table to reach the bottle.

2. **Lift Bottle:** Steps 9-12.  This is crucial to raise the bottle above the table's surface, clearing it for transport.

3. **Transport to Cabinet:** Steps 13-18. This movement involves moving the bottle to the vicinity of the cabinet.  It must avoid collisions with other objects.

4. **Position and Place Bottle on Cabinet:** Steps 19-26.  This is essential for precisely placing the bottle on the cabinet.  This requires fine motor control to ensure stability.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 26-27. This final movement safely moves the arm away from the bottle after placement.
