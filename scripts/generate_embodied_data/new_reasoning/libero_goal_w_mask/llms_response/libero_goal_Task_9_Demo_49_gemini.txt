## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location to a wine rack. The environment contains several objects: a wine bottle, a wine rack, a wooden cabinet, a cream cheese, a plate, a bowl, and a flat stove. The wine bottle is initially positioned on the table near a cream cheese and a flat stove, to the left of the rack. The wooden cabinet is to the right of the wine rack. The plate is to the right of the bowl.  The primary activity is the precise manipulation of the robotic arm to grasp the wine bottle, lift it, and place it gently onto the wine rack.  The intended outcome is the successful transfer of the wine bottle to the rack without damaging the bottle or surrounding objects.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed is:

1. **Approach and grasp the wine bottle:**  This involves navigating the arm to the bottle's location, avoiding obstacles (cream cheese, stove), orienting the gripper, and securely grasping the bottle. (Steps 0-13)
2. **Lift the wine bottle:** This involves raising the bottle vertically to a sufficient height to clear the table or floor. (Steps 14-17)
3. **Move the wine bottle to the rack:** This involves carefully transporting the bottle to the wine rack, taking into consideration potential collisions and precise positioning above the rack. (Steps 18-21)
4. **Place the wine bottle on the rack:** This involves lowering the bottle onto the rack, ensuring stability and correct placement. (Steps 22-23)
5. **Release the wine bottle:** This involves opening the gripper to release the bottle onto the rack. (Steps 24-25)
