## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from its current location on the stove to a designated spot on the stove. The environment contains a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (center), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, cream cheese, and a bowl (all on the stove), and a plate (on the floor).  The primary activity is manipulation; the intended outcome is the bowl remaining on the stove, but potentially in a slightly different, more stable location.  The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Bowl:** The robot needs to move its arm towards the bowl.  This involves navigating the space and positioning the arm for grasping. (Steps 0-5)

2. **Grasp the Bowl:** The robot needs to grip the bowl securely to lift it. (Steps 6)

3. **Lift and Slightly Rearrange the Bowl:** The robot needs to lift the bowl and move it slightly to a more stable position. (Steps 7-15)

4. **Release the Bowl:** The robot needs to carefully release the bowl onto the stove. (Steps 16-17)
