## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move the Akita black bowl, located on the table, to the top of the wooden cabinet, situated on the right side of the table.  The robot must navigate around other objects on the table (wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, wine rack) to reach the bowl. It then needs to lift the bowl, transport it to the cabinet, and carefully place it on top. The general sequence involves approaching the bowl, grasping it, moving to the cabinet, and placing the bowl on the cabinet.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** Steps 0-5.  This is necessary to acquire the object to be moved.  The robot needs to position itself correctly to pick up the bowl without colliding with other objects on the table.

2. **Transport the Bowl to the Cabinet:** Steps 6-13. This movement is crucial for moving the grasped bowl to its destination. It involves navigating around obstacles to avoid collisions.

3. **Place the Bowl on the Cabinet:** Steps 14-18. This involves carefully positioning the bowl on the cabinet's surface and releasing it. Precision is crucial to avoid dropping or damaging the bowl or the cabinet.
