## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from a plate to a different location.  The environment contains a wooden floor/table, a cream cheese near the center, a wine bottle to the right of the cream cheese, a plate with a bowl on top of it to the right of the wine bottle, a wooden cabinet to the right of the plate, a flat stove to the left of the plate, and a wine rack to the right of the flat stove. The primary activity is grasping the bowl, lifting it from the plate, and placing it in a new, safe location.  The intended outcome is to have the bowl successfully moved off the plate without dropping it or causing damage.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:  approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl from the plate, moving the bowl to a safe location, and releasing the bowl.


High-level movements and their corresponding steps:

1. **Approach the bowl:** Steps 0-3.  This is necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the bowl to grasp it.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 4-5. This is crucial for picking up the bowl.

3. **Lift the bowl from the plate:** Steps 6-8. This separates the bowl from the plate.

4. **Move the bowl to a safe location:** Steps 9-11. This moves the bowl to a location where it won't fall.

5. **Release the bowl:** Steps 12-16. This completes the task.
