## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing a wine rack, a wine bottle (next to the rack), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), a cream cheese, and a flat stove. All these objects are situated on a wooden floor or table.  The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then manipulate the drawer handle to open it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** This involves navigating the environment to get within reach of the cabinet. (Steps 0-8)  The robot needs to avoid obstacles like the wine rack, bottle, plate, and bowl.
2. **Locate and Position for Drawer Opening:** This involves positioning the robotic arm correctly to interact with the drawer handle. (Steps 8-10) The arm needs to be precisely oriented to grasp the handle effectively.
3. **Open the Drawer:** This is the final action, involving manipulating the handle to open the drawer. (Steps 10-13)  The robot will need to apply the correct force and movement to the handle.
