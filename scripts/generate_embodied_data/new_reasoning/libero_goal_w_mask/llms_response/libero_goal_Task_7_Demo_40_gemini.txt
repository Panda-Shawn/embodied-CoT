## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a flat stove located in the center of a room. The environment contains several objects: a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (center), a wine rack (above the stove), a wine bottle (left), cream cheese (right), a plate (location unspecified), and an Akita black bowl (center).  The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a lit stove.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to navigate to the stove, avoiding obstacles like the wine bottle and cabinet. This involves moving towards the center of the environment where the stove is located.

2. **Grasp the knob:** (Steps 5-7)  Once near the stove, the robot needs to position its gripper above the stove's control knob and securely grasp it.

3. **Rotate the knob:** (Steps 8-10) With the knob grasped, the robot needs to rotate it clockwise to turn on the stove.
