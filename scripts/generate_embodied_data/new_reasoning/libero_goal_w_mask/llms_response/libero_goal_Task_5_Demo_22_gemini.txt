## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to push a plate located in front of a stove to a position further in front of the stove.  The environment includes a stove, a plate situated directly in front of it, a wooden cabinet to the right, a wine rack to the left, a wine bottle and a bowl with cream cheese on the table. The primary activity is manipulating the plate's position. The intended outcome is the plate being pushed forward, closer to the user or a designated area in front of the stove.  The general sequence of movements involves approaching the plate, grasping it (implicitly, as the actions only describe pushing), pushing it forward, and then retracting the robotic arm.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach the Plate:** Steps 0-2. This movement is necessary to bring the robot arm into a position where it can interact with the plate.
2. **Push the Plate Forward:** Steps 3-7. This is the core action that fulfills the task instruction. The robot needs to apply force to the plate to move it to the desired location.
3. **Retract the Arm:** Steps 8-9. This final movement moves the arm away from the plate, completing the task.
