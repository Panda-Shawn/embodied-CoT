## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on the stove.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome was a functioning stove, ready for cooking. The relevant objects were the robotic arm itself, and the stove, located on the left side of a table amidst other objects (a wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate).  These objects were strategically irrelevant to the task, except for their location relative to the stove â€“ they occupy space the robot must navigate.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to the stove, avoiding obstacles. This involved positioning itself optimally for interaction with the stove's controls.
2. **Grasp the stove knob:** (Steps 5-6) The robot needed to accurately grasp the stove knob to manipulate it.
3. **Turn the stove knob:** (Steps 8-9) The robot needed to rotate the knob to the "on" position.
4. **Release the stove knob:** (Steps 10-12)  The robot needed to release the knob, completing the interaction.
5. **Stop:** (Step 7) The robot needs to cease movement to avoid accidental contact with the environment.
