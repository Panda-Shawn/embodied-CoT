## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl (implicitly present in the environment, though not explicitly mentioned in the objects list) from an unspecified location to the flat stove on the table.  The environment contains a cream cheese, wine bottle, plate, wooden cabinet, flat stove, and wine rack on a wooden floor or table. The cream cheese is on the table, the wine bottle is next to the plate, the wooden cabinet is near the wine rack, and the flat stove is on the table.  The robot needs to navigate around these objects to reach the bowl, pick it up, and then place it on the stove.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:  approaching the bowl, picking up the bowl, moving to the stove, and placing the bowl on the stove.

High-level movements:

1. **Approach Bowl:** Steps 0-3. This is necessary to get the robot arm in a position to grasp the bowl.  The assumption is the bowl is somewhere in front of the robot's starting position.

2. **Grasp Bowl:** Steps 3-5. This involves closing the gripper around the bowl to secure it.

3. **Move to Stove:** Steps 6-13. This involves moving the arm, carrying the bowl, around any obstacles to the stove.

4. **Place Bowl on Stove:** Steps 14-17. This involves carefully positioning the bowl on the stove and releasing it.
