## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table in a kitchen-like environment.  The environment contains several other objects: a wooden cabinet to the right, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle and a plate on the table, a bowl containing cream cheese. The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome is a powered-on stove.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needs to navigate to the stove, avoiding obstacles. This involves positioning itself appropriately for interaction with the stove's controls.

2. **Reach and grasp the stove knob:** (Steps 4-7) The robot must reach the stove knob with its gripper, ensuring a secure grip to enable rotation.

3. **Turn the knob:** (Step 10) Once gripped, the robot needs to rotate the knob to turn on the stove.

4. **Retreat:** (Step 9)  The robot needs to move away after completing the task.
