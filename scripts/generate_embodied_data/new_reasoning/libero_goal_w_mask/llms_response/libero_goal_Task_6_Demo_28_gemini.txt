## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to place a container of cream cheese into a bowl.  The environment contained a cream cheese container, a bowl, and several other distractor objects (wine bottle, plate, wooden cabinet, flat stove, wine rack) on a wooden surface. The cream cheese container was initially positioned near the bowl, but not inside it. The robot's goal was to grasp the cream cheese container and move it into the bowl.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to position itself to grasp the cream cheese container. This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the cream cheese, accounting for the presence of other objects.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 4-5) The robot needed to accurately grasp the cream cheese container using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move Cream Cheese to Bowl:** (Steps 6-10) The robot needed to lift the cream cheese container and precisely move it over the bowl. This movement required careful control to avoid collisions and ensure the container was above its target.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Bowl:** (Steps 10-12)  The robot needed to release the cream cheese container into the bowl.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 12-16)  The robot needed to move away from the bowl, leaving the cream cheese container safely inside.
