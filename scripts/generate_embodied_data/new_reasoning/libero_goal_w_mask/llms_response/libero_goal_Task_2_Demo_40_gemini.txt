## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a wine bottle from its current location on a wooden cabinet to a designated location on top of the same cabinet. The environment included a wooden cabinet with a wine rack, a cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate, all situated near a table and a stove.  The wine bottle was initially on the cabinet, the bowl on the table, and the plate on the floor. The primary activity was manipulation of the wine bottle, and the intended outcome was its repositioning on top of the cabinet.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 1-10) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position to grasp the wine bottle. This involved careful movement and tilting to approach the bottle.

2. **Lift and Secure the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 11-12)  This stage involved lifting the bottle after the gripper secured it.

3. **Move the Wine Bottle to the Desired Location:** (Steps 13-17) This phase focused on moving the grasped bottle to its final destination on top of the cabinet.

4. **Release the Wine Bottle and Retreat:** (Steps 18-21) The robot needed to release the bottle carefully and then retract its arm.
