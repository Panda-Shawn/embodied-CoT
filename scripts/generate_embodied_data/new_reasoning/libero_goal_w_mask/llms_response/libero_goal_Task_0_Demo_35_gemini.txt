## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located on the right side of a scene containing various objects: a wine rack (left), cream cheese (middle), wine bottle (near cream cheese), plate and bowl (right of the scene), and a flat stove (left). The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed are:

1. **Approach the cabinet:**  This involves moving the robotic arm towards the cabinet, navigating around potential obstacles like the cream cheese and wine bottle.  (Steps 0-7)

2. **Position for drawer opening:** This involves positioning the robotic arm appropriately above the middle drawer, accounting for the cabinet's orientation and the drawer's location.  (Steps 8-12)

3. **Open the drawer:** This involves executing the action to open the drawer using the robotic arm's end-effector. (Steps 13-15)
