## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack (next to the cabinet), a wine bottle (next to the wine rack), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), and a cream cheese, all situated on a wooden floor or table.  A flat stove is also present. The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the cabinet's middle drawer, and the intended outcome is to have the drawer open.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves navigating the robot from its initial position to a location directly in front of the cabinet.  This spans steps 0-1.
2. **Position for drawer access:** The robot needs to position itself appropriately to reach the middle drawer's handle or opening mechanism.  This spans steps 2-6.
3. **Open the drawer:** This involves the physical act of pulling or pushing the drawer open. This spans steps 7-9.
4. **Verify and halt:** The robot should stop and verify that it has successfully opened the drawer. This spans steps 10-12.
