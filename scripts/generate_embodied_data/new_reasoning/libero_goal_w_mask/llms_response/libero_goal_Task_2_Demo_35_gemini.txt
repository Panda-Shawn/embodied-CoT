## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet next to a table, onto the top surface of the same cabinet.  The environment also contains a cream cheese, a bowl on the table, a plate on the floor, and a stove on the table.  The primary activity is manipulation: picking up the wine bottle and placing it in a designated location. The intended outcome is the wine bottle resting securely on top of the cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the wine bottle, positioning itself appropriately, and closing the gripper to securely grasp the bottle. (Steps 1-9)
2. **Lift the Wine Bottle:** This involves lifting the bottle from its current position on the cabinet. (Steps 11-13)
3. **Move to the Target Location:** This stage involves maneuvering the robotic arm with the grasped bottle to a suitable position above the target location on the cabinet. (Steps 14-18)
4. **Place the Wine Bottle:** The final stage involves carefully lowering the bottle onto the cabinet and releasing the gripper. (Steps 19-21)
