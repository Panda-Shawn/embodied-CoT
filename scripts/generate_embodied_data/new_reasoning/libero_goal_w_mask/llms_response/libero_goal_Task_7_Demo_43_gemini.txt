## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on the stove.  The primary activity was to manipulate the stove's control knob to the "on" position. The intended outcome was a functional stove, ready for use. The objects involved were the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially the stove's knob.  Other objects present in the environment (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, Akita black bowl) were irrelevant to the task.


The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the stove:**  Steps 1-4. The robot needed to navigate to the stove's location to be able to interact with its control knob.  This involved moving through the workspace, avoiding obstacles.

2. **Grasp the stove knob:** Steps 4-5.  The robot had to position its gripper over the stove knob and secure a grip.

3. **Turn the stove knob:** Steps 7-9. The robot needed to rotate the knob to the "on" position.  This involved precise rotational movement.

4. **Release and retract:** Steps 6 and 10. The robot released its grip on the knob after turning and moved away from the stove.
