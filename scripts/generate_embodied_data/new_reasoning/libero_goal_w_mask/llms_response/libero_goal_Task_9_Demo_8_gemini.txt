1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location to a designated wine rack. The environment contains several objects: a wine bottle (on the wine rack), a cream cheese to the left of the wine bottle, a plate in front of the wine bottle, a bowl to the left of the plate, a flat stove to the left of the bowl, and a wooden cabinet to the right of the wine rack. All objects rest on a wooden floor or table. The robot needs to approach the wine bottle, grasp it, lift it, and carefully place it onto the wine rack.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the wine bottle with its gripper.  This involves maneuvering around other objects and positioning itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 8-12) The robot must carefully position its gripper over the wine bottle and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and Move the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 13-20) This involves lifting the bottle from the rack, carefully moving it while accounting for its fragility, and potentially adjusting its orientation.

4. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack:** (Steps 21-24) The robot carefully places the wine bottle onto the wine rack.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 25-28) The robot moves away from the wine bottle and rack, opening the gripper.
