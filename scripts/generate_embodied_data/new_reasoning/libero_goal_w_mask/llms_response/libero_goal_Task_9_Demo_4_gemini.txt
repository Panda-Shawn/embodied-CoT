## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location to a wine rack. The environment includes a wooden floor/table, a wine rack, a wooden cabinet to the right of the wine rack, a cream cheese to the left of a plate, a bowl to the left of the wine bottle, and a flat stove also to the left of the wine bottle.  The wine bottle is initially on the rack. The primary activity is to manipulate the robotic arm to grasp the wine bottle and place it back onto the wine rack, implicitly implying that the wine bottle may have been initially slightly off the rack. The intended outcome is the wine bottle being securely positioned on the rack.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 0-10) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the wine bottle. This involves maneuvering around other objects in the environment.

2. **Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needs to acquire the wine bottle using its gripper.

3. **Return the Wine Bottle to Rack and Adjust Placement:** (Steps 14-25) This movement encompasses adjusting the position of the bottle on the rack.
