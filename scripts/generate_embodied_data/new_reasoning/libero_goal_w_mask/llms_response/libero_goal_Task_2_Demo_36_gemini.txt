## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a table amongst other objects (a plate, bowl, wooden cabinet, flat stove, and wine rack), to the top of the wooden cabinet.  The primary activity is the manipulation of the wine bottle, and the intended outcome is its secure placement atop the cabinet. The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp:** The robot approaches the wine bottle, positions itself for grasping, and secures the bottle in its gripper.  (Steps 0-9)
2. **Lift and Transport:** The robot lifts the wine bottle and transports it to the cabinet. (Steps 11-16)
3. **Place and Depart:** The robot places the bottle on the cabinet and then moves away. (Steps 17-22)


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach and Grasp | 0-9 | The robot needs to get close to the wine bottle, orient itself correctly, and grasp the bottle securely before attempting to lift and move it.  This requires careful maneuvering around other objects on the table. |
| Lift and Transport | 11-16 | After grasping the bottle, the robot must lift it clear of the table and then move it towards the cabinet.  This requires careful upward movement and controlled transportation to avoid collision and maintain stability. |
| Place and Depart | 17-22 |  Once the robot is positioned above the cabinet, it must carefully place the bottle, then retract its arm safely to prevent accidental knocks or drops. |
