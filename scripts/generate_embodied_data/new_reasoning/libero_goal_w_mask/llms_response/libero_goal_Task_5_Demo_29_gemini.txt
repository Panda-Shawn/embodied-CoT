## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved pushing a plate located in front of the stove to a position further in front of the stove.  The environment included a stove (in the middle), a plate (initially in front of the stove), a cabinet (right), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, a bowl containing cream cheese. The goal was to manipulate the plate's position relative to the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Plate:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to position itself close enough to the plate to be able to grasp and push it.

2. **Grasp and Prepare for Push:** (Steps 3-4) The robot needed to lower its arm and potentially tilt it to achieve a stable grasp on the plate.

3. **Push the Plate Forward:** (Steps 5-10)  The robot needs to push the plate forward and make sure its angle is correct.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needs to retract its arm after successfully pushing the plate.
