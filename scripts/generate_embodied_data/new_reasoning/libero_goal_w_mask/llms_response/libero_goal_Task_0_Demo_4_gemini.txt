## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The cabinet is located on the right side of a room or workspace.  Other objects present include a wine rack (left), cream cheese (middle), wine bottle (near cream cheese), plate (right of bowl), bowl (left of plate), and a flat stove (left). The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the cabinet's general location. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Position above the middle drawer:**  This requires maneuvering the arm to be directly above the target drawer, accounting for the cabinet's orientation and the drawer's position within it. (Steps 5-9)
3. **Reach for and grasp the drawer handle:**  This stage involves lowering the arm to engage with the drawer handle. (Steps 10-11)
4. **Open the drawer:** This involves a pulling motion. (Step 12)
5. **Return to a safe position:**  Final repositioning to a safe state (Steps 13-16)
