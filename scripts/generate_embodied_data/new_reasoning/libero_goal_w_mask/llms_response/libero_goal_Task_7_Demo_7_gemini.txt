## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove. The environment contains a stove located on the left side of a table, a wooden cabinet on the right, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle and a plate on the table, a bowl containing cream cheese.  The primary activity is to reach the stove's controls and activate them. The intended outcome is a functioning stove, indicated by a lit burner or indicator light. The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needs to navigate to the stove's location, avoiding obstacles. This involves a leftward and possibly downward movement to reach the stove's vicinity.

2. **Grasping the knob:**  The robot must reach out and grasp the stove knob, which is assumed to be within reach after approaching the stove. This requires a downward movement and closure of the gripper.

3. **Turning the knob:**  Once the knob is grasped, the robot needs to rotate it to turn the stove on.  This involves a clockwise rotation.


**High-Level Movements:**

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approaching the stove (Steps 1-5):**  This involves moving the robotic arm towards the left and downwards to position itself near the stove, avoiding obstacles like the cabinet and other items on the table. This movement positions the arm for the next steps.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasping the knob (Steps 5-6):** This involves reaching down to grasp the stove knob, requiring the gripper to close around the knob.  This sets the stage for the turning action.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Turning the knob (Step 8):** This entails rotating the grasped knob clockwise to activate the stove.
