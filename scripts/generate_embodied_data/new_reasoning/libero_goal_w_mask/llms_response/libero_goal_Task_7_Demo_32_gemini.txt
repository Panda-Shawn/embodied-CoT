## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on the stove.  The primary activity involved manipulating the stove's control knob to activate the burner. The intended outcome was a lit stove burner. The relevant objects were the stove (located on the left side of a table), and the robot arm itself. Other objects present (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, Akita black bowl) were irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-3) This involved positioning the robot arm in close proximity to the stove's control knob.  This was necessary to enable subsequent interaction with the knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** (Steps 4-6)  This involved reaching the stove knob and securely gripping it with the robotic gripper.  This was essential to be able to rotate the knob.

3. **Turn the knob:** (Step 8) This involved rotating the knob to the "on" position. This was the final action needed to complete the task.

4. **Stop:** (Steps 7, 9)  This involved halting the robot's movements after completing the task.
