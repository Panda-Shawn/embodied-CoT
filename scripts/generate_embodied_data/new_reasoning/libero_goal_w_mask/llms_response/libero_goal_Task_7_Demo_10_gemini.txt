## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove.  The environment contains a stove located on the left side of a table, along with other objects such as a cabinet (right side), wine rack (near the cabinet), wine bottle, cream cheese (left side), a plate, and an Akita black bowl. The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a powered-on stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Stove:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needs to navigate to the stove's location, avoiding obstacles and positioning itself for interaction with the stove knob.  This involves moving to the general area of the stove.

2. **Grasp the Knob:** (Steps 3-4) The robot must accurately grasp the stove knob using its gripper. This requires precise positioning and closure of the gripper.

3. **Rotate the Knob:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot must then rotate the knob clockwise to turn on the stove.

4. **Stop:** (Steps 5, 9) The robot needs to stop its actions after successfully turning on the stove and after reaching the stove.
