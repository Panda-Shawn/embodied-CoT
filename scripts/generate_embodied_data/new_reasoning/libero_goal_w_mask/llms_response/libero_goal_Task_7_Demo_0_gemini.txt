## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table.  The environment includes a stove (left side of table), a wooden cabinet (right side of table), a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate on the table. The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome is a functioning stove, indicated by the stove's indicator light or other visual/auditory cues.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position near the stove's controls.  This spans steps 0-2.  This is necessary to bring the manipulator within reach of the stove's controls, avoiding collisions with other objects on the table.

2. **Position above the controls:**  The robot needs to position itself directly above the stove's controls to precisely interact with them. This spans steps 3-4. Precise positioning is crucial for successful interaction and to avoid damaging the stove or surrounding objects.

3. **Grasp the controls:** The robotic arm needs to grasp the stove's controls to turn them.  This spans steps 5-7.  This is the essential step for manipulating the stove's controls.

4. **Turn on the stove:** Once grasped, the robot arm needs to rotate the knob to the "on" position. This spans step 9. This is the final action to achieve the task goal.

5. **Retract:** The arm needs to safely retract after turning on the stove.  This is implied by step 8 (stop).
