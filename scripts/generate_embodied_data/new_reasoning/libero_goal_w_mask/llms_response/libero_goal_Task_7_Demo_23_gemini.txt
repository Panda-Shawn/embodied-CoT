## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove located on a table within a kitchen-like environment. The primary activity was manipulating the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome was a functional, ignited stove.  Objects involved included the stove (on the left side of the table), a wooden cabinet (on the right), a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle and a cream cheese on the table, and an Akita black bowl also on the table.  These objects were irrelevant to the task itself but present in the robot's environment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involved navigating the robot arm to a position close enough to interact with the stove's controls (steps 0-2).
2. **Grasp the control knob:** The robot needed to position its gripper over the knob and securely grasp it (steps 3-6).
3. **Turn the knob:** This involved rotating the knob to the "on" position (steps 9-11).
4. **Return to a safe position:**  The final step involved stopping the arm's movement (step 8).
