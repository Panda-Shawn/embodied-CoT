## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet next to a table, to a designated location on top of the same cabinet.  The environment contains several other objects: a cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate on the table, and a stove also on the table. The primary activity is manipulation of the wine bottle, and the intended outcome is its placement on the cabinet's top surface. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involves: approaching the bottle, grasping the bottle, lifting the bottle, and placing the bottle on the cabinet.


Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** This encompasses steps 0-7. The robot needs to navigate to the wine bottle and secure a grip on it.

2. **Lift the Wine Bottle:** This covers steps 8-11. The robot lifts the bottle from its initial position on the cabinet.

3. **Move and Position the Wine Bottle:** This includes steps 12-19. The robot manipulates the bottle to reach its final desired location on top of the cabinet.

4. **Release the Wine Bottle:** This stage comprises steps 20-23. The robot carefully releases its grip, placing the bottle in the target location.
