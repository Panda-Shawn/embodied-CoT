## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The primary activity is manipulating the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome is a lit stove. The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially the knob or switch on the stove itself. Other objects are present (cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, plate) but are irrelevant to the task.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:**  Steps 0-3. The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can interact with the stove's controls.

2. **Position itself for interaction:** Steps 4-6. The robot needs to lower its arm and adjust its position to precisely reach the stove's control knob or switch.

3. **Engage the control:** Steps 7-8. The robot must grasp the control (knob or switch) and turn it to activate the stove.

4. **Complete the action and stop:** Step 9. The robot turns the knob to the 'on' position.
