## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet next to a table, to a different position on the same cabinet. The environment includes a table with a bowl, a plate, a cream cheese, and a stove; a cabinet next to the table with a wine bottle already on it and a wine rack. The robot needs to pick up the wine bottle from its current position on the cabinet and place it in another location on the same cabinet. This likely involves several high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bottle (steps 0-10):** The robot moves to a position above the wine bottle, carefully aligning its gripper, and then grasps the bottle.
2. **Lift and Retract (steps 11-14):** After grasping the bottle, the robot lifts the bottle to a clear distance from the cabinet to avoid collision during repositioning.
3. **Reposition Above Target (steps 15-20):** The robot carefully maneuvers itself above the new target location for the wine bottle.
4. **Lower and Place (steps 21-23):** The robot lowers the bottle to the new desired position on the cabinet.
5. **Release and Depart (steps 24-25):** The robot opens its gripper, releasing the bottle and moving away to a stop position.
