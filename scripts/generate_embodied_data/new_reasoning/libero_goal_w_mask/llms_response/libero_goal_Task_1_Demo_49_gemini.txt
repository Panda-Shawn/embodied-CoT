## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from its current location to the stove.  The environment contains a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (center), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate, all situated on a wooden surface (floor or table). Initially, the bowl, along with the wine bottle, cream cheese, and plate, are on the stove. The goal is to reposition the bowl (no specific location on the stove is specified).  The robot needs to perform the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl (Steps 0-5):** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the bowl, positioning the gripper above it, and then closing the gripper to securely grasp the bowl. This is necessary to pick up the bowl for transportation.

2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl (Steps 6-9):**  This phase lifts the grasped bowl and moves it to a position suitable for placement on the stove. This step is essential to move the bowl clear of its original position and to prepare to put it down.

3. **Place the Bowl on the Stove (Steps 10-12):** This involves moving the bowl to the stove surface and opening the gripper to release the bowl. It's a crucial step to complete the main task.

4. **Retract Arm (Steps 13-16):**  The robot retracts its arm to avoid any obstacles after completing the placement. This is a standard safety measure post-task completion.
