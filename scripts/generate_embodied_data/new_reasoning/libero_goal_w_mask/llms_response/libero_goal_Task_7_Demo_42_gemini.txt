## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table in a kitchen-like environment.  The environment contains several other objects: a wooden cabinet to the right of the table, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle and a plate on the table, a bowl containing cream cheese. The primary activity is to locate the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a functional, lit stove.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-2.  This involved navigating to a position where the robot arm can reach the stove's control knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** Steps 3-6. The robot needs to position its gripper over the knob and securely grasp it.

3. **Rotate the knob:** Steps 9-11. Once grasped, the robot needs to rotate the knob to turn the stove on.

4. **Retract:** Steps 7-8 and 12. The robot needs to return to a safe position after successfully turning on the stove.  Step 7 and 8 are likely a retraction to avoid interference after tilting the hand down to operate the knob; Step 12 is the final retraction/stopping action.
