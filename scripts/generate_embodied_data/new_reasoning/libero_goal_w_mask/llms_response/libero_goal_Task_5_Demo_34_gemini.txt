## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a plate located in front of a stove to a position further in front of the stove.  The environment includes a stove in the middle, a plate in front of it, a wooden cabinet on the right, a wine rack above the stove, a wine bottle on the left, a cream cheese, a bowl, and other objects. The primary activity is pushing the plate, and the intended outcome is its repositioning closer to the front edge of the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Plate:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to get into a position where it can manipulate the plate. This involves moving down to the level of the plate and positioning its arm appropriately.

2. **Push the Plate:** (Steps 5-8) This involves grasping and applying controlled force to move the plate.

3. **Retreat and Adjust:** (Steps 9-14)  After pushing the plate, the robot needs to safely retract its arm, and make final adjustments to ensure the plate has been moved to the desired location.
