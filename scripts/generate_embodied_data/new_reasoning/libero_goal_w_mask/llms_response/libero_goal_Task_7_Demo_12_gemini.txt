## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove located on a table.  The environment included a stove (target), a wooden cabinet, a wine rack, a wine bottle, a bowl containing cream cheese, and a plate, all situated on a table. The cabinet was to the right, the stove to the left. The robot needed to navigate to the stove, locate the control knob, and rotate it to the "on" position.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Stove:** (Steps 1-7)  The robot needed to move from its initial position to a location close enough to the stove to interact with the control knob. This involved navigating around other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp the Knob:** (Steps 7-8) The robot had to position its gripper over the stove knob and securely grasp it.

3. **Rotate the Knob:** (Steps 9-12)  The robot needed to rotate the knob to the "on" position. This likely involved some trial and error to find the correct rotation direction and angle.

4. **Return to a safe position:** (Step 13) The robot moves to a position away from the stove after completing the task.
