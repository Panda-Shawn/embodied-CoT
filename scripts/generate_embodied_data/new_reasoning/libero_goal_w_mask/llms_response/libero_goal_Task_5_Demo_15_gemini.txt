## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to push a plate located in front of a stove to the front of the stove.  This seemingly simple instruction requires careful manipulation considering the surrounding environment.  The environment consists of a wooden surface with a stove in the middle, a cabinet on the right, a wine rack and several other objects (wine bottle, cream cheese, Akita bowl) on the left.  The plate is initially positioned in front of the stove.  The goal is to not disturb other objects while moving the plate to a position that would typically be considered "in front of the stove," even though it already is in front. This could imply a slight adjustment in position.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the plate:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to maneuver itself into a position where it can safely grasp or push the plate without colliding with other objects. This involves careful positioning to avoid the objects on the left.

2. **Engage the plate:** (Steps 6-10) Once positioned, the robot needs to make contact with the plate and prepare for pushing. This likely involves tilting the arm downward to make proper contact.

3. **Push the plate:** (Steps 11-14)  The robot exerts force on the plate to move it to the desired location. This is a short and controlled movement.

4. **Retract:** (Step 15) The robot retracts from the plate once the task is completed.
