## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a wine bottle onto a wine rack. The environment contained a wooden cabinet with a wine rack, a wine bottle situated on the table near the cabinet, a cream cheese, a bowl, a plate, and a flat stove. The bowl and plate were near each other, and the cabinet was close to the stove. The primary activity was to pick up the wine bottle and move it to the wine rack. The intended outcome was to have the wine bottle successfully placed on the wine rack.  The general sequence of high-level movements included:

1. **Approach the Wine Bottle:** The robot needed to maneuver itself to a position where it could grasp the wine bottle. This involved navigating around other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp the Wine Bottle:** The robot needed to precisely position its gripper and then close it around the wine bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:**  The robot needed to lift the wine bottle and move it to the wine rack.

4. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack:** The robot needed to carefully position the bottle on the rack, avoiding dropping it or damaging either the bottle or the rack.

5. **Retreat:** The robot needed to move away from the wine rack after successfully placing the bottle.


High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:

1. **Approach the Wine Bottle:** Steps 0-10.  This involved tilting the arm to get a better view (steps 0-2), rotating to orient towards the bottle (steps 3-6), and then moving closer to the bottle (steps 7-10).
2. **Grasp the Wine Bottle:** Steps 11-13.  The robot moved down towards the bottle (steps 11-12) and closed the gripper (step 13).
3. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:** Steps 14-20. This involved lifting the bottle (steps 15-17), potentially adjusting its orientation as it lifted it (steps 18-20).
4. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack:** Steps 21-27. Moving the bottle above the rack and repositioning before gently lowering it (steps 21-27).
5. **Retreat:** Steps 28-34. Moving away to a safe position (steps 28-34) after placing the bottle.
