## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is situated on a wooden floor or table, alongside a wine bottle, a plate, a cream cheese, a bowl, and a flat stove. A wine rack is positioned next to the cabinet. The primary activity involves manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then exert the necessary force to open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot includes:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** The robot needs to navigate from its starting position to a location in front of the cabinet where it can reach the drawer. This involves moving forward and potentially adjusting its orientation. (Steps 0-3)

2. **Position for Drawer Interaction:**  The robot must position itself directly in front of the middle drawer, adjusting its orientation for optimal access. This requires precise movements to avoid obstacles. (Steps 4-9)

3. **Open the Drawer:** This final step involves reaching for the drawer handle and applying the appropriate force to open it. (Steps 10-16)
