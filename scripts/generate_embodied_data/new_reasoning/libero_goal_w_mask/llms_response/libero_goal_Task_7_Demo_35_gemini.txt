## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task "turn on the stove" involves manipulating a stove's control knob to activate the stove's heating element.  The stove is located on the left side of a table, amidst other objects including a cabinet (right side), a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, cream cheese in a bowl, and a plate. The primary activity is reaching the stove knob, grasping it, and rotating it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a lit stove, indicating successful activation.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 0-4)  This involves navigating the robot arm to a position above the stove knob, avoiding obstacles like the cabinet, wine rack, bottle, bowl and plate.  This is necessary because the robot must be positioned correctly before it can interact with the stove knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** (Steps 5-6) This involves lowering the arm to precisely grasp the stove knob using its gripper. This is essential for the subsequent rotation of the knob.

3. **Rotate the knob:** (Steps 8-12) This entails rotating the knob clockwise to the "on" position. The precise rotation is needed to actuate the stove.

4. **Retract:** (Step 7)  The arm retracts after successfully turning on the stove.
