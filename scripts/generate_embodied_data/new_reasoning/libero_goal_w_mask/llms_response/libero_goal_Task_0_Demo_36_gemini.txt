## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing a wine rack (next to a wine bottle), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), a cream cheese, and a flat stove.  The wine rack is situated next to the cabinet. The primary activity is manipulating the robot arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** Steps 0-2. The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet's vicinity.  This involves moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the cabinet.

2. **Precise Positioning:** Steps 3-7. This stage focuses on fine-tuning the robot's position and orientation to accurately reach the drawer handle.  This includes counterclockwise rotations and tilting downwards to align with the drawer.

3. **Open Drawer:** Steps 8-11.  After reaching the optimal position, the robot executes a movement to open the drawer, likely engaging the drawer handle.  This may involve a lateral movement (left/right) depending on how the drawer handle is positioned.

4. **Stop:** Step 9. The robot stops after successfully opening the drawer.  Step 11 is also a stop to confirm the successful opening.
