## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet situated in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack (left of the cabinet), a wine bottle and a flat stove (on a table), a plate, cream cheese (left of the plate), and a bowl (right of the plate). The primary activity is manipulating the robot arm to locate and open the middle drawer. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed can be decomposed as follows:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position in front of the cabinet, avoiding obstacles.  This likely spans steps 0-10.
2. **Locate and grasp the drawer handle:** This involves precisely positioning the arm's end-effector to grasp the handle of the middle drawer. This likely spans steps 10-15.
3. **Open the drawer:** This involves applying force to the handle to open the drawer. This likely spans steps 15.
