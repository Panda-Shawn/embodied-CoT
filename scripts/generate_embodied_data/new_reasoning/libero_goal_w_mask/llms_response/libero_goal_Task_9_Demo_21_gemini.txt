## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location to a wine rack. The environment contains several objects: a wine bottle (on a plate, in front of the wine rack), a cream cheese (to the left of the wine bottle), a plate (in front of the wine bottle), a flat stove (to the left of the plate), an Akita black bowl (to the right of the stove), a wooden cabinet (to the right of the wine rack), and a wine rack (the target location). The robot needs to navigate around these objects to reach the wine bottle and then place it on the wine rack.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the Wine Bottle:** The robot must maneuver itself to a position where it can grasp the wine bottle. This involves avoiding obstacles like the plate, cream cheese, and stove.

2. **Grasping the Wine Bottle:**  The robot needs to carefully grasp the bottle without knocking it over or damaging it. This requires precise manipulation of the gripper.

3. **Lifting and Moving the Wine Bottle:**  Once the bottle is grasped, the robot lifts it and transports it to the wine rack, carefully avoiding collisions with other objects.

4. **Placing the Wine Bottle:** The robot carefully positions the wine bottle on the wine rack.

5. **Departing:** The robot moves away from the wine rack.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approaching the Wine Bottle (Steps 0-5):**  The robot rotates and potentially adjusts its position to get a clear approach path towards the wine bottle, avoiding obstacles.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasping the Wine Bottle (Steps 6-11):** The robot moves down, then closes the gripper to grasp the bottle.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Lifting and Moving the Wine Bottle (Steps 12-17):** The robot lifts the bottle and moves it to the area of the wine rack.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Placing the Wine Bottle (Steps 18-22):**  The robot positions the bottle on the rack.

* **High-Level Movement 5: Departing (Steps 23-24):** The robot opens its gripper and stops.
