## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its location on a table to a wine rack on the floor.  The environment includes a table with a wine bottle, a plate, and possibly other items; and the floor with a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack.  The robot must navigate around other objects on the table and floor to successfully place the bottle on the rack.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle (Steps 0-10):** This involves rotating to face the bottle, lowering the arm to reach it, and then closing the gripper to grasp it.  This is necessary to secure the bottle for transport.

2. **Lift and Transport the Bottle (Steps 11-15):**  After grasping the bottle, the robot lifts it clear of the table to avoid collisions during transport to the rack. Movement is then initiated towards the wine rack.

3. **Position the Bottle on the Rack (Steps 16-20):**  This involves maneuvering the bottle above the rack, carefully aligning its position.

4. **Release and Retreat (Steps 21-26):** The robot then opens the gripper to release the bottle, and retracts the arm to avoid collision and to finish the task.
