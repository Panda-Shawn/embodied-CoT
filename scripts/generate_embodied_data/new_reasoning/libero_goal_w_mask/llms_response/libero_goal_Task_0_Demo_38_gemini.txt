1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The cabinet is located in an environment containing a wine rack (next to a wine bottle), a plate (next to a bowl), a cream cheese, and a flat stove. The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then manipulate the drawer handle to open it.

The high-level movements identified in the robot's trajectory are:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** Steps 0-2. The robot needed to move towards the cabinet, initially navigating around other obstacles.  The exact path is not precisely defined but involves a general forward motion and minor adjustments in orientation.

2. **Position for Drawer Manipulation:** Steps 3-6.  Once close to the cabinet, the robot adjusted its position and orientation to accurately target the middle drawer. This likely involved fine-grained movements to approach the drawer handle from an optimal angle and distance.

3. **Open the Drawer:** Steps 7-12.  This stage involves the actual opening of the drawer. While the details are limited by the coarse-grained movement vocabulary, it involves stopping, possibly readjusting slightly, and then executing the drawer opening operation.
