## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on a stove located on a table in a kitchen-like environment.  The intended outcome was to successfully switch the stove on.  The objects involved included the stove (on the left side of the table), a wooden cabinet (on the right), a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, a cream cheese in a bowl, and a plate, all situated on the table.  The robot needed to navigate to the stove, locate the control knob, and rotate it to the "on" position.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Stove:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needed to move to a position where it could effectively interact with the stove's control knob. This involved navigating around other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp the Knob:** (Steps 4-6) The robot needed to position its gripper over the stove's knob and securely grasp it.

3. **Turn the Knob:** (Steps 8-8) The robot needed to rotate the knob to turn the stove on.  A clockwise rotation is assumed to be needed.

4. **Release the Knob:** (Steps 10-12) The robot needed to release its grip on the knob after successfully turning it on.

5. **Stop and return:** (Steps 7 & 13) The robot ends the task.
