## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a plate located in the center of a table to the front of a stove, also situated on the table.  The environment included a wooden cabinet to the right, a wine rack behind the stove, a wine bottle on the table, cream cheese to the left, and a bowl near the plate. The primary activity was manipulating the plate using a robotic arm. The intended outcome was the plate's repositioning in front of the stove.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the plate:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to initially position itself close enough to the plate to grasp it. This involved moving forward and adjusting its height to reach the plate's level.

2. **Grasp the plate:** (Steps 5-6) After approaching, the robot had to carefully grasp the plate without disturbing it. This involved a downward movement and slight tilting upward to ensure a secure grip.

3. **Lift and move the plate to the stove:** (Steps 7-12)  With the plate grasped, the robot needed to lift it, and then move it to the desired location at the front of the stove. This included maneuvering around potential obstacles (though none directly interfered based on the description).

4. **Release the plate:** (Steps 13) Once above the desired location, the robot released the plate.
