## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The stove is located on the left side of a table.  The environment also contains a wooden cabinet (right side of the table), a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate (all on the table). The primary activity is to locate the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a lit stove burner.  The robot needs to navigate to the stove, grasp the knob (assuming it's a rotary knob), and rotate it.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Navigate to the stove:** This involves moving the robotic arm from its initial position to a position above the stove knob. This spans steps 0-4.  This movement is necessary to bring the robot's gripper within reach of the stove knob.

2. **Grasp the stove knob:** This involves closing the gripper around the stove knob.  This spans steps 4-6. This movement is essential to gain control of the knob for rotation.

3. **Rotate the knob to the "on" position:** This involves rotating the gripper clockwise to activate the stove. This spans steps 8-10. This action directly accomplishes the task goal.

4. **Stop:** This involves ending the action sequence after successful rotation. This is step 7 and 11.
