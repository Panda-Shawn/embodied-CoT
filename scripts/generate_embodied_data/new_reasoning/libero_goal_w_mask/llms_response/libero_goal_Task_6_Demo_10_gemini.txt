### Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move the cream cheese from its current location (a bowl next to a plate on a table) to a specified bowl.  The environment contains several distractor objects (wine bottle, wooden cabinet, stove, wine rack) that the robot must avoid. The primary activity is the precise manipulation of the cream cheese container, requiring careful grasping and controlled movement. The intended outcome is the successful transfer of the cream cheese from its original bowl to another, without dropping or damaging it or interacting with other objects.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the cream cheese:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese bowl, avoiding obstacles.  This involves moving towards the table, and positioning itself for grasping.

2. **Grasp the cream cheese:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot executes the actions needed to pick up the cream cheese bowl.

3. **Lift and move the cream cheese:** (Steps 9-15) The robot lifts the cream cheese and moves it to the target location (assumed to be a slightly offset bowl due to the subsequent movements).

4. **Place the cream cheese:** (Steps 15-17) The robot gently lowers and releases the cream cheese into the destination bowl.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-22) The robot moves away from the bowl, completing the task.
