## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on the stove.  The intended outcome was to have the stove's switch in the "on" position. The objects involved were the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially other objects on the table (cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, plate).  These objects' positions are irrelevant to the task, except the stove being on the left side.  The robot needed to navigate to the stove, reach the switch, and activate it.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robotic arm to a position directly above the stove's switch, preparing for interaction. This was necessary to bring the end-effector to an appropriate position for grasping the switch.

2. **Grasp the stove switch:** Steps 5-6. This involved moving the arm downward and closing the gripper to engage the stove switch. This was necessary to manipulate the switch.

3. **Activate the switch:** Steps 8-10.  This involved tilting the arm downward and rotating the switch to turn it "on".  This was crucial to complete the "turn on the stove" task.

4. **Stop:** Step 7. This involved halting all movement to end the task. This is crucial to signify the task's completion and avoid unintended actions.
