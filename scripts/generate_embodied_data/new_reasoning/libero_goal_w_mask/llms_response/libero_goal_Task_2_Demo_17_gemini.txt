## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current position on a table to the top of a wooden cabinet, also on the table.  The environment contains several other objects: a cream cheese, a plate, a flat stove, and a wine rack, all situated on the same table.  The primary activity is manipulation: grasping the wine bottle, lifting it, and placing it on the cabinet. The intended outcome is the wine bottle resting securely on the cabinet's top surface.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 1-9) The robot needs to position itself appropriately to pick up the bottle. This involves navigating to the bottle's location and carefully grasping it with its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 11-16)  After grasping the bottle, the robot must lift it and move it towards the cabinet.  This requires careful maneuvering to avoid obstacles and maintain a stable grip.

3. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Cabinet:** (Steps 17-22) The robot needs to position itself above the cabinet and carefully place the bottle on its surface. This requires precise positioning and releasing the grip at the right moment.
