### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The primary activity is to locate the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a functioning stove, ready for use. The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially the knob itself. Other objects present (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, plate) are irrelevant to the task.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach Stove:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to navigate to the stove's location. This involves moving towards the left side of the table where the stove is situated.

2. **Grasp Knob:** (Steps 3-5)  The robot needs to position its gripper above the stove's knob and grasp it securely.  This requires careful positioning and closing the gripper.

3. **Turn Knob:** (Steps 8-9) Once the knob is grasped, the robot needs to rotate it clockwise to turn the stove on.

4. **Release Knob:** (Steps 10-12) The robot then releases the knob.
