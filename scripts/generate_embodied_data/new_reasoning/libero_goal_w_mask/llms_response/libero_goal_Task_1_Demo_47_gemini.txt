## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to place a bowl onto the stove.  The environment contained a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (center), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate, all situated on a wooden surface (floor or table).  The bowl, wine bottle, cream cheese, and plate were initially on the stove. The primary activity was manipulation of the bowl. The intended outcome was the bowl's placement on the stove, assuming it was not already correctly positioned.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the bowl. This involved navigating around other objects on the counter/table.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** (Steps 6-7) The robot had to close its gripper around the bowl to secure it for lifting.

3. **Lift and move the bowl:** (Steps 8-12)  The robot lifted the bowl and moved it above the stove to a position for placement.

4. **Place the bowl:** (Steps 13-17)  The robot placed the bowl on the stove by opening its gripper and adjusting its position.
