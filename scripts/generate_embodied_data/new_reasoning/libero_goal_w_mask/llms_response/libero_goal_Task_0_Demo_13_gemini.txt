## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack near a wine bottle, a plate near a bowl, and the cabinet itself near the wine rack.  The primary activity was to manipulate the robotic arm to locate the middle drawer of the cabinet and then open it. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** (Steps 0-4)  This initial phase involved moving the robotic arm towards the cabinet, adjusting its orientation to approach from an appropriate angle. This was necessary to get the arm into a position to interact with the cabinet's handles or mechanisms.

2. **Locate the middle drawer:** (Steps 5-10)  The robot needed to precisely position itself to interact with the middle drawer. This involved both maneuvering the arm closer and adjusting the orientation to accurately target the drawer handle or opening mechanism.

3. **Open the drawer:** (Steps 11-14) This phase involved the robot interacting directly with the drawer using appropriate force and movement to pull it open.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 15-18)  After successfully opening the drawer, the robot moved away to a safe position, avoiding any potential collisions.
