## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table. The environment includes a stove on the left side of the table, a wooden cabinet on the right, and various other objects (wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, plate) which are irrelevant to the task. The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob, and the intended outcome is to switch the stove on.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal involves:

1. **Approach the stove:** The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the stove's control knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot must grasp the stove's control knob using its gripper.

3. **Turn the knob:** The robot needs to rotate the knob clockwise to turn on the stove.

4. **Release and retract:** The robot needs to release the knob and move away from the stove.

**High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:**

* **Approach the stove (Steps 0-3):** This involves positioning the robot arm within reach of the stove knob.  This is necessary because the robot initially starts at a distance from the stove and must reposition itself for the next steps.

* **Grasp the knob (Steps 4-5):** This is crucial for manipulating the knob to turn on the stove.  The robot needs to have a secure grasp to perform the rotation.

* **Turn the knob (Steps 7-9):** This is the core action for completing the task. This action directly results in the stove being turned on.

* **Release and retract (Step 6):**  This is essential for the safety and efficient operation of the robot. This ensures the robot does not impede the operation of the stove and prepares it for subsequent actions.
