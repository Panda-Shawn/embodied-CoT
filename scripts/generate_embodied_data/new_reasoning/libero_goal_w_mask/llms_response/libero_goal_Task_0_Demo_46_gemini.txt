## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The cabinet is located in an environment containing a wine rack (next to a wine bottle), a plate (on a table, next to a bowl and cream cheese), and a flat stove.  The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves navigating the environment to get close enough to the cabinet to interact with it.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Position for drawer interaction:** This involves positioning the robotic arm's gripper above the middle drawer, accounting for the cabinet's orientation and the drawer's location. (Steps 4-8)
3. **Open the drawer:** This involves using the gripper to grasp the drawer handle and open the drawer. (Steps 9-11)
4. **Return to neutral position (optional):** The robot might return to a neutral position to signal task completion, though this is not explicitly required. (Steps 12-15)
