## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from its current location on the cabinet to a specified location on top of the same cabinet.  The environment contains a wooden cabinet on the right side of a table, a bowl on top of the cabinet, a cream cheese, a wine bottle, a plate (in front of the cabinet), a flat stove, and a wine rack.  The primary activity is manipulation – specifically, grasping and repositioning the bowl. The intended outcome is the bowl resting securely on the cabinet’s surface.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** Steps 0-5. The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the bowl.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 6-13.  The robot must lower its gripper, grasp the bowl, and lift it slightly to confirm a secure grip.

3. **Reposition the bowl:** Steps 14-22.  The robot must carefully move the bowl to its target location on the cabinet.
