## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a wine bottle from its current location on a cabinet to a designated spot on top of the same cabinet.  The environment included a wooden cabinet, a wine bottle (on the cabinet), a bowl (on a table), a plate (on the floor), a cream cheese (on the table), and a stove (on the table). The cabinet is near a table. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to grasp the wine bottle, reposition it, and then release it. The intended outcome was to have the wine bottle successfully placed on top of the cabinet.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the wine bottle, grasping the bottle, lifting the bottle, moving the bottle to the target location, and releasing the bottle.


High-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp:** Steps 0-10.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the wine bottle to securely grasp it. The robot needed to maneuver around other objects to reach the bottle.

2. **Lift and Reposition:** Steps 11-16. This movement involved lifting the grasped bottle and moving it to the desired location on top of the cabinet.

3. **Release and Retreat:** Steps 17-20.  This movement was necessary to release the bottle carefully onto the cabinet and then retract the robotic arm to a safe position.
