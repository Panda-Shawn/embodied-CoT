1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove.  The stove is located on the left side of a table.  Other objects present on the table include a wine rack near a cabinet (on the right side of the table), a wine bottle, a plate with cream cheese, and an Akita black bowl. The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a functional stove, ready for use. The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach the Stove:** This involves navigating the robot arm from its initial position to a position near the stove's control knob.  This movement spans steps 0-4. The justification is that the robot must first get close to the target before it can interact with it.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasp the Knob:**  The robot needs to grasp the stove knob in order to turn it. This spans step 4.  The justification is that manipulating the knob requires a secure grip.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Rotate the Knob:** The robot needs to rotate the knob to turn the stove on. This spans steps 7-8. The justification is the only way to turn on the stove is to rotate the knob.
