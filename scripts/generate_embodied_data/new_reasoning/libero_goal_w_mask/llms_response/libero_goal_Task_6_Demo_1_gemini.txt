1. **Task Description and High-Level Movements**

The task is to transfer a container of cream cheese from its current location to a bowl.  The environment contains a small white plate (likely irrelevant), a round silver bowl (the target location), a bottle of wine, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack, all situated on a wooden table or floor.  The cream cheese's location is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory implies it's on the table near the bowl.  The high-level movements necessary are:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach the cream cheese.** (Steps 0-6)  This movement involves navigating the robot to a position above the cream cheese container.  This is necessary to prepare for grasping the object.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasp the cream cheese.** (Steps 6-7) This involves actuating the gripper to secure the cream cheese.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Lift and move the cream cheese to the bowl.** (Steps 7-11) This involves lifting the cream cheese container and moving it to a position above the bowl.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Position cream cheese above the bowl.** (Steps 11-13) Fine positioning above the bowl to ensure accurate placement.

* **High-Level Movement 5: Release the cream cheese into the bowl.** (Steps 13-16) This involves opening the gripper to release the cream cheese into the bowl.
