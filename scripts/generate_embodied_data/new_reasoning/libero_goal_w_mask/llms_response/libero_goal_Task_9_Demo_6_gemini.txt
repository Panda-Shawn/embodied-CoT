## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location on a table to a wine rack located behind it.  The environment includes a wine bottle on a table, a wine rack behind the bottle, a wooden cabinet to the right of the bottle, cream cheese to the left of a plate (irrelevant to the task), and a flat stove in front of the bottle.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the wine bottle:**  Steps 0-9.  This involves maneuvering the robotic arm into a position to grasp the bottle, avoiding obstacles like the stove.

2. **Grasp the wine bottle:** Steps 10-12. This involves precisely positioning the gripper and closing it around the bottle's neck.

3. **Lift and move the wine bottle to the rack:** Steps 14-20. This involves lifting the bottle, navigating around potential obstacles, and positioning it above the rack.

4. **Place the wine bottle on the rack:** Steps 21-23. This involves carefully lowering the bottle onto the rack and releasing the grip.

5. **Stop:** Steps 22-24. The task is completed.
