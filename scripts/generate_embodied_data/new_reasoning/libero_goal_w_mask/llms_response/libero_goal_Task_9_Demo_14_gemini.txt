## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location on a table to a wine rack located behind it.  The environment includes a wine bottle on a table, a wooden cabinet to the right of the bottle, a cream cheese to the left of a plate (irrelevant to the task), a flat stove in front of the wine bottle, and a wine rack behind the bottle.

The robot needs to approach the wine bottle, grasp it, lift it, move it over to the wine rack, carefully place it on the rack, and then retract.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp:** (Steps 0-11)  The robot needs to position itself correctly to grasp the bottle. This involves maneuvering around potential obstacles (stove) and orienting its gripper for a secure grip.

2. **Lift and Transport:** (Steps 12-22) The robot lifts the bottle and moves it to the wine rack, accounting for the distance and potential for collision with the cabinet.

3. **Place on Rack:** (Steps 23-28) The robot carefully places the bottle onto the wine rack, ensuring it is stable and positioned correctly.

4. **Retract:** (Steps 29-32) The robot returns to a neutral position, releasing the bottle and preparing for a potential next task.
