## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table in a kitchen-like environment. The stove is on the left side of the table, while a wooden cabinet, a wine rack, a wine bottle, a bowl containing cream cheese, and a plate are present elsewhere on the table.  The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls (assumed to be a knob) to turn it on. The intended outcome is a change in the stove's state from "off" to "on."

The high-level movements are:

1. **Reach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot arm around other objects on the table to get into position above the stove's controls. (Steps 0-3)
    * Justification: The robot needs to position itself correctly to interact with the stove's controls.  It needs to avoid collisions with other objects on the table.
2. **Grasp the knob:** This involves using the gripper to secure the stove's control knob. (Steps 4-6)
    * Justification:  The robot needs to have a firm grip on the knob in order to rotate it.
3. **Turn the knob:** This involves rotating the knob clockwise to turn on the stove. (Steps 8-10)
    * Justification:  This action directly activates the stove.
4. **Return to neutral:** This involves bringing the arm to a resting position. (Step 7)
    * Justification: This is a safety and efficiency measure to prepare for further actions.
