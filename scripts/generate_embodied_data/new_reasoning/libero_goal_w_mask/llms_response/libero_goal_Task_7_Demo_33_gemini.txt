## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a flat stove located in the center of a kitchen-like environment.  The environment contains several other objects: a wooden cabinet to the right, a wine rack and cream cheese to the left, a wine bottle, bowl, and plate on a table or counter. The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a functioning stove, indicated by its ignition.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:**  This involves moving the robotic arm towards the stove's location, navigating around other objects in the environment.  (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot needs to position its gripper above the stove knob and securely grasp it. (Steps 3-5)
3. **Turn on the stove:** Once the knob is grasped, the robot rotates it to the "on" position. (Steps 7-9)
4. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the stove. (Step 6 is implicit retreat, though no explicit movement is detailed for it)
