## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing several other objects: a wine rack (near the cabinet and a wine bottle), a wine bottle (near the wine rack), a cream cheese, a plate (near a bowl), a bowl (near the plate), and a flat stove (on a table).  The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** This involves navigating the robot from its starting position to a location in front of the cabinet.  This likely spans steps 0-4.  This is necessary because the robot needs to be close enough to interact with the cabinet's drawers.

2. **Locate the middle drawer:** Once near the cabinet, the robot needs to orient itself correctly to target the middle drawer. This likely spans steps 5-7.  Accurate positioning is crucial for successful drawer opening.

3. **Open the drawer:** After correct positioning, the robot must execute the action of opening the drawer. This spans steps 8-11.  This is the final stage of the task, accomplishing the instruction.
