## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a container of cream cheese from its current location to a bowl. The primary activity was grasping the cream cheese container and depositing it within the bowl. The intended outcome was to have the cream cheese container successfully placed inside the bowl.  The objects involved were a bowl (containing cream cheese), a cream cheese container, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, a wine rack, a wine bottle, and a plate. The bowl with cream cheese was located in the center of the workspace, along with the wine bottle. The cabinet was on the right, the stove in the middle, and the wine rack on the left. The plate was also on the right side, near the cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cream cheese container:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese container, positioning itself for a grasp.
2. **Grasp the cream cheese container:** (Steps 5-6)  The robot needed to acquire a firm grip on the container.
3. **Lift and move the cream cheese container to the bowl:** (Steps 8-11) The robot had to lift the cream cheese container and transport it to the bowl.
4. **Place the cream cheese container into the bowl:** (Steps 11-13) The robot carefully positioned and released the container into the bowl.
5. **Retreat:** (Steps 16-17) The robot moved away to a safe distance, completing the task.
