## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a cabinet next to a table, to a position on top of the same cabinet.  The environment contains a wooden cabinet, a wine rack (presumably on the cabinet), a cream cheese, a bowl (on the table), a plate (on the floor), and the target wine bottle (initially on the cabinet). The stove is also on the table, but plays no role in the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 0-8) The robot needs to position itself to grasp the wine bottle. This involves maneuvering around any obstacles and adjusting its arm to reach the bottle.

2. **Lift and Move the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 9-12)  Once grasped, the robot lifts the wine bottle and moves it slightly upward to ensure a clear path.

3. **Adjust the Wine Bottle Position:** (Steps 13-17) The robot adjusts the position of the wine bottle to place it correctly on the top of the cabinet.

4. **Release the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 17-19)  The robot releases the wine bottle, placing it in the desired location.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 20-21) The robot moves away from the cabinet.
