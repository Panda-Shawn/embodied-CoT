## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is situated in an environment containing several other objects: a wine rack (adjacent to the cabinet), a wine bottle (near the wine rack), a cream cheese, a bowl, a plate (the bowl is next to the plate), and a flat stove (on a table).  The primary activity is to manipulate the robotic arm to reach the cabinet drawer, and the intended outcome is the drawer being opened.

The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal are likely to be:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** This involves navigating the robot arm from its starting position to a point where it can interact with the cabinet's handle.  (Steps 0-9)  This is necessary because the robot arm needs to be in close proximity to the cabinet to be able to interact with the drawer. The initial movements suggest a path around objects (wine rack and possibly the wine bottle).

2. **Locate and Grasp the Drawer Handle:** Once close to the cabinet, the robot needs to precisely position itself to accurately grasp the drawer handle. (Steps 10-16)  This requires fine adjustments in position and orientation to engage the handle.

3. **Open the Drawer:** After grasping the handle, the robot executes the action of opening the drawer. (Steps 17-20). This involves pulling or pushing the handle, depending on the drawer's mechanism.
