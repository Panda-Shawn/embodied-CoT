## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to open the top drawer of a cabinet and place a bowl inside. The robot's environment included a cabinet (with a drawer), a bowl, and other objects (wine rack, cream cheese, plate, wine bottle, stove) on a table.  The bowl was located on the table, near the cabinet. The primary activity was manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the goal of transferring the bowl into the drawer. The intended outcome was the bowl being successfully placed inside the opened top drawer of the cabinet.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the cabinet and locate the drawer:** Steps 0-7.  This involved maneuvering the robot arm to a position where it could interact with the cabinet drawer.
2. **Open the drawer:** Steps 8-15. This involved positioning the arm to grasp the drawer handle, opening the drawer handle, and verifying that the drawer is open.
3. **Approach the bowl and grasp it:** Steps 16-20. This involved positioning the arm to reach the bowl, using the gripper to pick up the bowl.
4. **Lift the bowl and transfer it to the drawer:** Steps 21-34. This was complex and included adjusting grip and orientation to keep the bowl stable.
5. **Place the bowl in the drawer:** Steps 35-41.  This involved precise positioning to place the bowl inside the drawer and release the grip.
