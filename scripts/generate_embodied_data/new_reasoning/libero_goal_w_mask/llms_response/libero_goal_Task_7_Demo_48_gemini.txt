## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove. This involves locating the stove, reaching it with the robotic arm, and then manipulating the control knob to turn the stove on.  The stove is located on the left side of a table, among other items such as a cabinet (right side), wine rack (near the cabinet), wine bottle, cream cheese in a bowl, and a plate. The robot needs to navigate around these objects to reach the stove's control knob.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the general vicinity of the stove, avoiding obstacles.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Reach the stove knob:**  The robot needs to position itself directly above and close enough to the stove's control knob. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Turn on the stove:** This involves grasping the knob and rotating it to the "on" position. (Steps 9-10)
4. **Stop:** The task is complete. (Step 8)
