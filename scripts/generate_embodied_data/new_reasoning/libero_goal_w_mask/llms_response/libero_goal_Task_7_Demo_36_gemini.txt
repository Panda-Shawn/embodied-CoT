## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove. The stove is located on the left side of a table.  The environment also contains a wooden cabinet (on the right), a wine rack (near the cabinet), a wine bottle, cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate (all on the table). The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls (assumed to be a knob) to turn it on. The intended outcome is a visibly activated stove. The robot needs to navigate to the stove, grasp the knob (assuming it's a knob-like control), rotate it to the "on" position, and release its grip.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the stove, avoiding obstacles.  (Steps 0-3) Justification:  The robot must position itself correctly to interact with the stove.

2. **Grasp the stove knob:** This involves precisely positioning the gripper above the knob and closing the gripper to secure a grip. (Steps 4-6) Justification: The robot needs to firmly grasp the control to rotate it effectively.

3. **Rotate the knob:** This involves rotating the knob clockwise to the "on" position. (Steps 8-10) Justification: This action activates the stove.

4. **Release the knob:** This involves opening the gripper to release the knob. (Steps 11-12) Justification:  The robot must release the control after activating it.

5. **Stop:** The task is completed (Steps 13) Justification: The goal of turning on the stove has been reached
