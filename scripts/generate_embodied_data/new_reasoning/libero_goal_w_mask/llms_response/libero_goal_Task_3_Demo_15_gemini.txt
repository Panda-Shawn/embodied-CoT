## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bowl from a tabletop and placing it inside the top drawer of a nearby cabinet. The environment included a cabinet with a drawer, a bowl, and other objects (wine rack, cream cheese, wine bottle, plate, stove) on a table. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to open the drawer, grasp the bowl, and deposit it into the drawer. The intended outcome was a bowl successfully placed inside the open top drawer.  The general sequence involved approaching the cabinet, opening the drawer, reaching for the bowl, grasping the bowl, moving the bowl to the drawer, and placing the bowl inside.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** Steps 0-4. This was necessary to position the robotic arm within reach of the cabinet drawer.  The robot moved forward and to the right, adjusting its position to optimally approach the drawer.

2. **Open the top drawer:** Steps 5-18. This involved positioning the robotic arm to manipulate the drawer handle, opening the drawer, and confirming the drawer was open.

3. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 19-28. The robot needed to locate and grasp the bowl before moving it to the drawer. This includes navigating to the bowl's location and precisely closing its gripper around the bowl.

4. **Place the bowl in the drawer:** Steps 29-34.  This final step involved moving the grasped bowl into the open drawer and releasing it. Adjustments to tilt and placement were necessary to ensure the bowl was securely placed inside.
