## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to push a plate located on a table to the front of a stove, also located on the table.  The environment includes a wooden cabinet (right), a stove (center), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, cream cheese, a bowl, and the target plate, all situated on the table. The robot needs to navigate to the plate, grasp it (implicitly, as the actions only describe pushing), push it towards the stove, and then retract.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the plate:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself appropriately to engage with the plate.
2. **Push the plate:** (Steps 5-7)  The robot engages with the plate and applies force to push it.
3. **Retreat:** (Steps 8-13) The robot moves away from the plate and stove to a safe position.
