## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a container of cream cheese from its location on a table to a bowl, also situated on the table. The environment contained various objects: a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (middle), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle (middle), a bowl containing cream cheese (center), and a plate (left).  The primary activity was the grasping and transportation of the cream cheese container to the bowl. The intended outcome was to successfully deposit the cream cheese into the bowl.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the cream cheese:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position directly above the bowl of cream cheese.  This spans steps 0-4.  This movement was necessary to bring the robot arm into a position suitable for grasping the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp the cream cheese:** This involves actuating the gripper to secure the cream cheese container. This spans steps 4-5.  This movement was necessary to acquire the object to be moved.

3. **Lift and move the cream cheese to the bowl:** This involves lifting the cream cheese container and transporting it to the target bowl. This spans steps 6-10. This movement was necessary to transport the cream cheese from its original position to the bowl.

4. **Position and release the cream cheese into the bowl:** This involves positioning the cream cheese container above the bowl and releasing it. This spans steps 10-16. This movement was necessary to deposit the cream cheese into the bowl.
