## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from atop a plate to a location such that the bowl is no longer on the plate.  The environment contains a wooden surface with several objects: a cream cheese, a wine bottle, a plate with a bowl on it, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack.  The plate with the bowl is located to the right of the wine bottle. The primary activity is manipulation of the bowl, the intended outcome is the bowl being separated from the plate.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the plate:** Steps 0-5. The robot needs to navigate to the plate without colliding with other objects.  This requires maneuvering around the cream cheese and wine bottle.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 6-6. The robot needs to securely grasp the bowl to prepare for lifting.

3. **Lift the bowl:** Steps 7-9. The robot needs to lift the bowl vertically.

4. **Move the bowl off the plate:** Steps 10-12. The robot needs to move the bowl to a position clear of the plate, while keeping a stable grip on it.

5. **Release the bowl:** Steps 13-16. The robot needs to safely release the bowl.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 17-17. The robot needs to move away from the plate to avoid disturbing it.
