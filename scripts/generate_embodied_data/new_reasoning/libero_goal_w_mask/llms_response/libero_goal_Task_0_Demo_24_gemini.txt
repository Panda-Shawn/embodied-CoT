## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in a kitchen-like environment.  The environment contained several objects: a cream cheese near the center, a wine bottle to its right, a plate to the right of the wine bottle, the wooden cabinet to the right of the plate, a flat stove to the left of the plate, and a wine rack to the right of the stove. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to locate the cabinet, approach the middle drawer, and then open it. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** This involved navigating the robot from its starting position to a position in front of the cabinet. (Steps 1-11)
2. **Locate and Position Above Drawer:**  The robot needed to precisely position itself above the middle drawer to be able to reach the handle. (Steps 12-13)
3. **Open the Drawer:** This involved manipulating the drawer handle to open the drawer. (Steps 14-19)
4. **Retreat:** The robot moved away from the cabinet after successfully opening the drawer. (Steps 20-21)
