## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a plate located in the center of a table to the front of a stove, also on the table.  The environment contains several other objects: a wooden cabinet (right), a wine rack (behind the stove), a wine bottle (on the table), cream cheese (left side of the table), and a bowl (near the plate). The primary activity is pushing the plate; the intended outcome is the plate's location at the front of the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the plate:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to get close enough to the plate to grasp it or push it effectively.  This involves maneuvering around other objects on the table.

2. **Push the plate:** (Steps 5-10)  The robot pushes the plate towards the stove. This might involve some adjustments to maintain a stable push and avoid obstacles.

3. **Stop:** (Step 11) The robot stops after successfully pushing the plate to its destination.
