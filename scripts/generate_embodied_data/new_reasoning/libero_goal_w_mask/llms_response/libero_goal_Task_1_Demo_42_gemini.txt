## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl (implied by the instruction "put the bowl on the stove") from an unknown location to the flat stove on the floor. The environment contains several objects: a cream cheese, a wine bottle, a plate, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack, all situated on either the floor or a table. The robot needs to locate the bowl, grasp it, and then carefully place it onto the stove's surface without causing any damage or collisions.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved: locating the bowl, approaching and grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl to the stove, and placing the bowl on the stove, releasing the grip, and finishing the task.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Locate and Grasp Bowl:** (Steps 0-5)  The robot needs to find the bowl (its initial position is unknown from the problem description) and acquire a stable grasp. This is necessary before any movement towards the stove can commence.

2. **Lift and Transport Bowl to Stove:** (Steps 6-12) The robot lifts the bowl and moves it towards the stove. This phase involves navigation around potential obstacles in the environment (wine bottle, plate, etc.) while ensuring the bowl remains secure.

3. **Place Bowl on Stove and Release:** (Steps 13-18)  The robot positions the bowl on the stove and carefully releases its grip.  Accurate placement is crucial to successfully complete the task.
