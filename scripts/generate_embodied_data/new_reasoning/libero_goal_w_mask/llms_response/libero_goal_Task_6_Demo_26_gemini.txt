## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a container of cream cheese from its current location to a bowl.  The cream cheese was initially located somewhere near the other objects on the table or floor (wine bottle, plate, wooden cabinet, wine rack, flat stove). The bowl was also on the table or floor. The goal was to manipulate the robotic arm to grasp the cream cheese and deposit it inside the bowl.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the cream cheese. This involved navigating the environment and reaching the cream cheese's approximate location.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 7-11)  Once in proximity, the robot needed to grasp the cream cheese using its gripper. This involved precise positioning and closing the gripper.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** (Steps 11-17) After grasping the cream cheese, the robot needed to lift it off the surface.  This stage also involves avoiding collisions and maintaining a stable grip.

4. **Move to Bowl:** (Steps 17-26) The robot then had to navigate to the bowl's location. This may involve avoiding obstacles.

5. **Position over Bowl:** (Steps 26-29) Precise positioning above the bowl is crucial for successful transfer. This allows controlled lowering.

6. **Deposit Cream Cheese:** (Steps 29-34) Finally, the robot needed to release the cream cheese into the bowl. This involves opening the gripper at the correct position and height above the bowl.
