1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place a bowl inside.  The cabinet is near a wine rack. The bowl is initially on the floor.  Other objects present include cream cheese (on the cabinet), a wine bottle, a plate, and a stove (both on the floor). The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal are:

1. **Approach the cabinet and locate the top drawer:** (Steps 0-3) This initial movement positions the robot arm in front of the cabinet to prepare for opening the drawer.

2. **Open the top drawer:** (Steps 4-14) The robot needs to reach the drawer handle, grasp it, and open it.

3. **Retrieve the bowl:** (Steps 15-23) The robot needs to find the bowl on the floor, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place the bowl in the drawer:** (Steps 24-26) This movement involves placing the bowl inside the opened drawer.
