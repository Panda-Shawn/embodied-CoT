## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location to a wine rack.  The environment includes a wine bottle, a wine rack, a wooden cabinet to the right of the wine rack, a cream cheese to the left of the wine bottle, a plate to the right of the wine bottle, a flat stove to the left of the wine bottle, and an Akita black bowl to the left of the plate.  All these objects are situated on a wooden floor or table. The robot needs to navigate around these objects to reach the wine bottle, grasp it, and then transport it to the wine rack, placing it carefully. The general sequence of movements involves: approaching the wine bottle, grasping it, lifting it, moving to the wine rack, and placing it on the rack.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Wine Bottle:** Steps 0-10.  This involves navigating to the wine bottle, positioning the gripper, and securing the bottle.  The robot needs to avoid obstacles (cream cheese, stove, plate, bowl, cabinet) while approaching the bottle.

2. **Lift and Transport Wine Bottle:** Steps 11-20. This involves lifting the bottle from the table and moving it towards the wine rack. The robot needs to maintain a stable grip and avoid collisions.

3. **Place Wine Bottle on Rack:** Steps 21-28. This involves positioning the bottle over the wine rack and carefully releasing it.  Precise positioning is crucial to ensure stable placement on the rack.
