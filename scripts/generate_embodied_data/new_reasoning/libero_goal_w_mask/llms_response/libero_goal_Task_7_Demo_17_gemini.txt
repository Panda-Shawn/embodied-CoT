## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a lit stove. The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and potentially other objects on the table (a wooden cabinet to the right, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate).  These objects are obstacles that the robot must navigate around.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot includes:

1. **Navigate to the stove:** The robot needs to move from its initial position to a location where it can reach the stove's control knob.  This involves avoiding collisions with other objects on the table. (Steps 0-5)

2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot needs to position its gripper over the stove's knob and securely grasp it. (Steps 6-7)

3. **Turn the knob:** The robot needs to rotate the knob clockwise to turn on the stove. (Steps 8-11)

4. **Retreat:** The robot needs to move away from the stove after successfully turning it on. (Step 12)
