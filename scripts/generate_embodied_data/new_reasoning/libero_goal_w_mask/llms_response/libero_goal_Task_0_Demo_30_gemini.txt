## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack (next to the cabinet), a wine bottle (next to the wine rack), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), a cream cheese, and a flat stove.  The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to reach the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and open it. The intended outcome is a successfully opened middle drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot is:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet, avoiding obstacles. This likely involves moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the cabinet.  (Steps 0-2)

2. **Position Arm for Drawer Opening:**  The robot must position its arm and gripper correctly to grasp the drawer handle. This includes moving downwards to the drawer's approximate height and potentially adjusting its orientation. (Steps 3-6)

3. **Grasp Drawer Handle:** The robot needs to precisely position its gripper to grasp the drawer handle. This may involve subtle adjustments in position and orientation. (Steps 7-9)

4. **Open Drawer:** The robot will then exert force to open the drawer. (Step 10)

5. **Confirmation and Stop:** The robot needs to confirm successful drawer opening and then stop. (Steps 11-13)
