## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in an environment containing several other objects: a wine rack (near the cabinet and a wine bottle), a wine bottle, a plate, a cream cheese, a bowl (near the plate), and a flat stove.  The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to locate and open the middle drawer of the cabinet. The intended outcome was the drawer being opened.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the cabinet, precisely positioning the arm to reach the drawer handle, and then manipulating the handle to open the drawer.

High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** Steps 0-7. This involved navigating the robot from its initial position to a position directly in front of the cabinet, accounting for potential obstacles (wine rack, wine bottle).  This was necessary to bring the robot within reach of the cabinet's middle drawer.

2. **Position Arm for Drawer Handle:** Steps 8-10. This involved positioning the robotic arm's end effector above and over the drawer handle. The vertical movement (Step 9) is crucial for precisely reaching the handle. This was needed to prepare for manipulating the drawer handle.

3. **Open Drawer:** Steps 11-12. This involved a horizontal movement to grasp and open the drawer.  This was the final step to complete the task instruction.
