## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl (implicitly present in the environment, though not explicitly listed) from its unknown initial location to the top of the wooden cabinet. The environment contains several objects: cream cheese, wine bottle, plate, wooden cabinet, flat stove, and wine rack.  The cream cheese and stove are on the table, the wine bottle and plate are together, and the cabinet is near the wine rack. The robot needs to navigate around these objects to reach the cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot first needs to locate and approach the bowl.  This involves navigating the cluttered workspace to reach the bowl's location. (Steps 0-6).
2. **Grasp the bowl:** After reaching the bowl, the robot must grasp it securely using its gripper. (Steps 7-7)
3. **Lift and move to cabinet:**  The robot then lifts the bowl and transports it to the cabinet. This requires navigating around obstacles to avoid collisions while carefully holding the bowl. (Steps 8-14).
4. **Place the bowl on cabinet:** Finally, the robot places the bowl on the top surface of the cabinet and releases its grip. (Steps 15-18).

```python
trajectory_features = {
    0: "stop",
    1: "move forward",
    2: "move forward down",
    3: "move down",
    4: "move backward down",
    5: "move backward down, close gripper",
    6: "close gripper",
    7: "stop",
    8: "move up",
    9: "move right up",
    10: "move right",
    11: "move right down",
    12: "move down",
    13: "move backward down",
    14: "move backward",
    15: "move backward, open gripper",
    16: "open gripper",
    17: "move up, open gripper",
    18: "move up",
}
