## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on a table in a kitchen-like environment.  The environment contains several objects: a wooden cabinet (right side), a flat stove (left side), a wine rack (near cabinet), a wine bottle and plate (on the table), a bowl containing cream cheese. The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome is a functioning, lit stove.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved approaching the stove, positioning the robotic arm appropriately, and then interacting with the stove's controls (likely a knob).

High-level movements identified from the trajectory:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-2.  This movement was necessary to bring the robotic arm into a position where it could reach the stove's controls. The robot needed to navigate around the objects on the table to avoid collisions and efficiently reach the stove.

2. **Position gripper over stove knob:** Steps 3-6.  This involved getting the gripper in close proximity to the stove knob to allow for manipulation. This step incorporates fine-grained movements, necessary for accurate grasping.

3. **Turn the stove knob:** Steps 7-11. This step rotates the knob to turn on the stove, completing the task.  This is the goal-oriented movement.
