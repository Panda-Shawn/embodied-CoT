## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a cabinet next to a table, to a new location on top of the same cabinet. The environment includes a wooden cabinet with a wine rack, a cream cheese, a bowl on the table, a plate on the floor, and a wine bottle initially positioned on the cabinet.  The robot needs to grasp the wine bottle, carefully lift it, and then reposition it on the cabinet.  This implies a sequence of actions involving approaching the bottle, grasping it, lifting it slightly to clear any obstacles, moving it to the desired location, and then releasing it.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to maneuver its arm to reach the wine bottle and securely grasp it.  This involves navigating potential obstacles and positioning the gripper for a firm hold.

2. **Lift and Clear:** (Steps 6-10) After grasping, the robot lifts the bottle slightly to ensure it's clear of the cabinet's surface and any other objects that might be in the way.  A small lift is sufficient since the target location is on the same surface.

3. **Move and Position:** (Steps 11-14) The robot then moves the bottle horizontally to its desired location on top of the cabinet.  This may involve minor adjustments in orientation to ensure the bottle is placed correctly.

4. **Place and Release:** (Steps 15-20) Once the bottle reaches the target location, the robot carefully lowers it and releases its grip.
