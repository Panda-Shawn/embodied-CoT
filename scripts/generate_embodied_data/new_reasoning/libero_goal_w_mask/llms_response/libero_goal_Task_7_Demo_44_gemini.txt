## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to turn on a stove.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove's control knob to switch it on. The intended outcome was a functioning, ignited stove. The relevant objects were the stove (located on the left side of a table), and the robot arm itself. Other objects (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate) were present in the environment but irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:**  This involved moving the robot arm to a position close enough to the stove to interact with its control knob. (Steps 1-4)
2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot needed to grasp the stove's knob to be able to rotate it. (Steps 5-7)
3. **Rotate the knob:** The robot rotated the knob to the "on" position. (Steps 16-18)
4. **Release the knob:** After successfully turning the knob, the robot released its grip. (Steps 9-15)
5. **Retreat:** Finally, the robot moved away from the stove. (Steps 11-12)
