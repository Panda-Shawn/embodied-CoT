## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove located on a table within a scene containing several other objects: a wooden cabinet (right), a wine rack (near cabinet), a wine bottle, cream cheese on a plate, and an Akita black bowl.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove's controls to activate it. The intended outcome was a functioning, lit stove.  The general sequence involved approaching the stove, reaching the control knob, turning the knob, and then retracting.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 1-4)  The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the stove's control knob without colliding with other objects. This involved moving backward and to the left, likely to avoid the cabinet and other items on the table.

2. **Reach and grasp the knob:** (Steps 5-11) Once near the stove, the robot needed to position its gripper to grasp the knob.  This involved downward movements and tilting the gripper to ensure a secure grasp.

3. **Turn the knob:** (Steps 13-15)  After grasping the knob, the robot needed to rotate the knob to turn on the stove.

4. **Retract:** (Step 12) The robot then needed to move away from the stove, releasing its grip on the knob.
