## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl located on the left side of a table, amongst other objects (cream cheese, wine bottle, plate, flat stove, wine rack), to the top of a wooden cabinet situated on the right side of the table. The primary activity is the manipulation and transportation of the bowl. The intended outcome is the bowl resting securely on top of the cabinet.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves: 1) approaching and grasping the bowl; 2) lifting and transporting the bowl; and 3) placing the bowl on the cabinet.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl:** This high-level movement spans steps 0-3.  The robot needs to navigate to the bowl's location and securely grasp it using its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport Bowl:** This movement encompasses steps 4-12.  The robot lifts the bowl, avoiding collisions with other objects, and moves it towards the cabinet.

3. **Place Bowl on Cabinet:** This movement covers steps 13-17. The robot carefully positions the bowl on top of the cabinet and releases it.
