## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place a bowl inside.  The cabinet is located near a wine rack. The bowl, along with a cream cheese, a plate, and a wine bottle, is situated on a table. The flat stove is also on the table. The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the drawer and the bowl. The intended outcome is the bowl being successfully placed inside the open top drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the Cabinet:** The robot needs to move itself into a position where it can effectively interact with the top drawer of the cabinet.

2. **Opening the Drawer:** The robot must locate and manipulate the drawer handle to open the drawer.

3. **Picking up the Bowl:** The robot must locate the bowl on the table, grasp it securely, and lift it.

4. **Placing the Bowl in the Drawer:** The robot must maneuver the bowl into the open drawer and carefully place it inside.

5. **Retreating:**  The robot needs to move away from the cabinet after completing the task.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:

| High-Level Movement         | Step Range | Justification                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Cabinet     | 0-5         | To position itself for drawer manipulation.                                                          |
| Opening the Drawer          | 6-14        | To gain access to the interior of the drawer for placing the bowl.                               |
| Picking up the Bowl         | 15-20       | To acquire the bowl and prepare for placement.                                                     |
| Placing the Bowl in Drawer   | 21-28       | To put the bowl inside the open drawer.                                                              |
| Retreating                   | 29-34       | To move away from the cabinet after task completion.                                               |
