## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location on a table to a wine rack situated to its right.  The environment includes a wine bottle, a wine rack (to the right of the bottle), a wooden cabinet (to the right of the wine rack), a cream cheese (to the left of a plate), a bowl (to the left of the wine bottle), and a flat stove (to the left of the wine rack). All objects rest on a wooden surface (table/floor).

The robot needs to execute the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the wine bottle:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needs to initially position itself appropriately to grasp the bottle.  This involves navigating through space, avoiding obstacles.  This high-level movement accounts for the steps the robot needs to reach the wine bottle.

2. **Grasp the wine bottle:** (Steps 5-11)  This involves precise maneuvering to align the gripper with the bottle and then closing the gripper to secure the bottle. The robot needs to reach the bottle from a reasonable position without hitting anything else on the table.

3. **Lift and transport the wine bottle:** (Steps 13-17) The robot lifts the bottle and moves it across the table to the area of the wine rack. This involved a smooth and controlled movement that would prevent the dropping of the bottle.

4. **Position and place the wine bottle on the rack:** (Steps 18-20)  Precise positioning above the rack is required to avoid dropping or tilting the bottle onto the rack.

5. **Release the wine bottle:** (Steps 21-26) The robot carefully releases the bottle onto the rack. Then it stops.
