## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a wine bottle from its current location on a table to a wine rack located to its right.  The environment contained several other objects: a wooden cabinet to the right of the wine bottle, a cream cheese to the left of a plate, a bowl to the left of the wine bottle, a flat stove to the left of the wine rack. The primary activity was grasping the wine bottle and moving it to the wine rack, ensuring its stable placement. The intended outcome was the wine bottle resting securely on the wine rack.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the Wine Bottle:** The robot needs to maneuver itself into a position where it can effectively grasp the bottle.  This involves navigating around the bowl to its left and the cabinet to its right. *(Steps 0-8)*

2. **Grasp the Wine Bottle:**  The robot needs to position its gripper over the bottle and securely grasp it. *(Steps 9-12)*

3. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:** The robot lifts the grasped bottle, moving it in an arc to avoid collisions with other objects while transporting it to the wine rack. *(Steps 14-20)*

4. **Place the Wine Bottle on the Rack:** The robot carefully positions the bottle on the wine rack and releases its grip. *(Steps 21-28)*

5. **Retract:** The robot moves away from the rack. *(Steps 29)*
