## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle from its current location on the table to the top of a wooden cabinet.  The environment contains several objects: a wine bottle, a plate, a bowl, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack, all situated on either the floor or a table. The wine bottle is initially on the table, and the cabinet is on the floor.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needs to maneuver itself into a position to grasp the bottle. This involves initial positioning and adjusting its orientation to properly align with the bottle.

2. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 8-15)  Once the bottle is grasped, the robot must lift it and move it toward the cabinet. This requires careful vertical movement to avoid knocking the bottle over.

3. **Position Above the Cabinet:** (Steps 16-24) The robot needs to position itself directly above the cabinet to prepare for placement. This involves horizontal and vertical adjustments to account for the cabinet's location and size.

4. **Place the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 25-29)  The final phase involves carefully lowering the bottle onto the cabinet's surface. This requires precise vertical and tilting movements to ensure a stable placement.
