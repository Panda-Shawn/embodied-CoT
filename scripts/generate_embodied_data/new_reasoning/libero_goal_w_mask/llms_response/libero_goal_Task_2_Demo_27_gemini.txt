## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet next to a table, to a different position on top of the same cabinet.  The environment includes a table with a bowl, plate, and stove, and a cabinet with a wine rack and cream cheese. The primary activity is manipulation, specifically grasping and repositioning the wine bottle. The intended outcome is the wine bottle being placed securely on top of the cabinet in a new location.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 0-10) This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above the wine bottle, while adjusting its orientation to achieve a stable grasp. Justification:  The robot needs to get close enough to the bottle to pick it up.


2. **Lift and Transport the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 11-16)  This involves lifting the bottle, potentially with some upward tilt to compensate for grip, then transporting it to the desired new location on the cabinet. Justification: The robot must move the bottle to its new location after successfully grasping it.

3. **Place the Wine Bottle:** (Steps 17-22) This involves positioning the bottle at the target location and releasing it.  Justification: The robot needs to carefully place the bottle at the target.
