## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a cabinet next to a table, to a different location on the same cabinet. The environment contains a wooden cabinet with a wine rack, a cream cheese, a plate, and a bowl on the table and a wine bottle on the cabinet.  The robot needs to grasp the wine bottle, lift it, and place it in a new position on the cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Wine Bottle (Steps 0-10):** The robot navigates to the wine bottle, positions its gripper, and grasps the bottle.
2. **Lift and Move the Wine Bottle (Steps 11-18):** The robot lifts the bottle, moves it to its new location, and maintains a stable grasp throughout this stage.
3. **Place and Release the Wine Bottle (Steps 19-21):** The robot carefully positions the bottle on the cabinet and then releases its grip.

**Step Range Justification:**

* **Steps 0-10 (Approach and Grasp):**  These steps involve maneuvering the robotic arm to the location of the wine bottle, positioning itself for a stable grip, and finally closing the gripper. The “stop” at step 0 and 11  indicates deliberate pauses for adjustments and to confirm positioning before proceeding.
* **Steps 11-18 (Lift and Move):** This phase is characterized by upward movement, followed by careful positioning on the target area. Adjustments in positioning (e.g., moving right) during the lift demonstrates the robot adapting to the environment.
* **Steps 19-21 (Place and Release):**  The final steps involve positioning the bottle securely and opening the gripper to release it.
