1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The primary activity is manipulating the stove's control knob to switch it on. The intended outcome is a lit stove burner. The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and the stove's control knob. Other objects in the environment (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, bowl, and plate) are irrelevant to the task.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position close enough to interact with the stove's control knob.  (Steps 0-4)  This is necessary because the robot needs to be in a suitable position before interacting with the knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** This involves positioning the gripper to grasp the stove knob securely. (Steps 5-7) This is crucial to successfully rotate the knob.

3. **Turn the knob:** This involves rotating the knob counterclockwise to turn on the stove. (Steps 8-12) This action directly achieves the task goal.

4. **Retract:** This involves moving the arm away from the stove after turning the knob. (Step 9) This is for safety and to avoid interference with the stove.
