## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a flat stove located in the center of a room.  The environment includes a wooden cabinet (right), a flat stove (center), a wine rack (left), a wine bottle, a cream cheese, a bowl, and a plate (all on a table/wooden floor). The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls (presumably a knob or switch) to activate it. The intended outcome is a lit stove, indicating successful power activation.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot to a position close enough to interact with the stove's controls.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the control knob:** The robot needs to position its gripper to grasp the presumed control knob or switch on the stove. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Turn the control knob:**  Once grasped, the robot must rotate the control knob to the "on" position. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Retreat:**  After successfully turning on the stove, the robot moves away to a safe distance. (Step 7)
