## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a bowl from its current location on the left side of a table to the top of a wooden cabinet located on the right side of the table.  The table also contains a cream cheese (left), a wine bottle (middle), a plate (center), a flat stove (left), and a wine rack (right). The primary activity is manipulation of the bowl, and the intended outcome is its placement on top of the cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to navigate to the bowl's location to pick it up.  This involves moving towards the bowl, avoiding other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** (Steps 4-5)  The robot must accurately position its gripper above the bowl and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and transport the bowl:** (Steps 6-10) The robot must lift the bowl, navigate around other objects on the table, and move toward the cabinet.

4. **Position the bowl on the cabinet:** (Steps 11-14)  The robot must precisely position the bowl on top of the cabinet, possibly requiring adjustments in tilt and position.

5. **Release the bowl:** (Steps 14-16)  The robot must release its grip on the bowl, ensuring it remains stable on the cabinet.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) The robot moves away from the cabinet.
