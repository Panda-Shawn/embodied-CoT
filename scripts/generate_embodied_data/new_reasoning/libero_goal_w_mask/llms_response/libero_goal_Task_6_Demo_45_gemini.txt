## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a container of cream cheese from its current location to a bowl.  The environment contains a wooden table with a small white plate, a round silver bowl (presumably containing nothing initially), a dark brown wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a wine rack. The cream cheese is assumed to be on the plate on the table. The bowl is also on the table.  The goal is to transfer the cream cheese from the plate to the bowl.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese container, which is assumed to be on the plate. This involves moving to the general area of the plate.

2. **Grasp the Cream Cheese:** (Steps 4-5) The robot must grasp the cream cheese container using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move to Bowl:** (Steps 6-10) The robot needs to lift the cream cheese and move it to the bowl.

4. **Place in Bowl:** (Steps 10-13) The robot deposits the cream cheese into the bowl.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-16) The robot moves away from the bowl.
