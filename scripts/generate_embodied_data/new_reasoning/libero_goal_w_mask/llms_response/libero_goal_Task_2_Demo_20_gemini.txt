## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a table amongst other objects (cream cheese, plate, wooden cabinet, flat stove, wine rack), and place it on top of the wooden cabinet, also situated on the same table. The primary activity is manipulation, specifically pick-and-place. The intended outcome is the wine bottle resting securely on the cabinet's surface.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal involved:

1. **Approaching and grasping the wine bottle:** The robot needs to maneuver itself to a position where it can effectively grasp the wine bottle without colliding with other objects.  This involves navigating to the bottle's location and adjusting its orientation for a proper grip.  (Steps 1-6)

2. **Lifting and transporting the wine bottle:** Once grasped, the robot lifts the wine bottle and moves it to a position above the cabinet. This requires careful control to prevent dropping the bottle and to account for potential obstacles. (Steps 7-12)

3. **Placing the wine bottle on the cabinet:** The robot carefully positions the wine bottle on top of the cabinet, ensuring stability. This involves precise movement and potentially adjusting orientation. (Steps 13-16)

4. **Retracting the robotic arm:** Finally, the robot retracts its arm, releasing the grip on the bottle and returning to a resting position. (Steps 17-20)
