## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet. The cabinet is located in an environment containing a wine rack, a wine bottle (next to the rack), a plate, a bowl (next to the plate), a cream cheese, and a flat stove.  The plate and bowl are on a table or wooden floor.  The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet, locate the middle drawer, and then manipulate the drawer handle to open it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:**  This involves navigating the environment to get into a position suitable for interacting with the cabinet. (Steps 0-11)
2. **Locate and position for drawer opening:**  This involves orienting the robotic arm to accurately target the middle drawer handle. (Steps 12-15)
3. **Open the drawer:** This involves actuating the drawer handle to open the drawer. (Steps 16-18)
