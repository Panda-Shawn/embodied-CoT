## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove. The primary activity is to manipulate the stove's controls (assumed to be a knob or switch) to activate it. The intended outcome is a lit stove, ready for cooking. The relevant objects are the stove (on the left side of a table), and the robot arm.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needs to move to a position where it can reach and interact with the stove's controls.
2. **Grasping the stove control:** The robot needs to grasp the control knob or switch of the stove.
3. **Rotating the control:** The robot needs to rotate the control to the "on" position.

Based on the trajectory, we can infer the following high-level movements:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approaching the stove (Steps 0-3):** This movement positions the robot arm near the stove. It involves navigating the environment to avoid obstacles. Justification: The stove is on the left side of the table, and the robot needs to reach it from its starting position.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasping the stove control (Steps 4-6):** This movement involves reaching the stove control and grasping it. Justification:  The robot needs to interact with the stove control to turn it on; grasping is necessary for manipulation.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Rotating the control (Steps 8-10):** This movement turns the stove control to activate the stove. Justification: This is the final action needed to complete the task of turning on the stove.
