### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The intended outcome is to have the stove's switch in the "on" position.  The relevant objects are the stove (located on the left side of a table), and the robot arm.  Other objects in the environment (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, Akita black bowl) are irrelevant to the task. The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needs to navigate to the stove's location.
2. **Locating the switch:** The robot must identify and precisely position itself near the stove's switch.
3. **Activating the switch:** The robot must manipulate the switch to turn the stove on.

**High-Level Movements:**

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approaching the stove (Steps 1-4):** This involves moving the robot arm towards the general vicinity of the stove.  This is necessary to bring the robot into a position from which it can reach the stove's switch.
* **High-Level Movement 2: Locating the switch (Steps 5-8):**  This involves fine-grained maneuvering to position the robotic gripper directly over the stove's switch. Precise positioning is crucial for successful switch manipulation.
* **High-Level Movement 3: Activating the switch (Steps 9-11):** This involves grasping the switch and rotating it to the "on" position.  The gripper must firmly grasp the switch to ensure reliable activation.
* **High-Level Movement 4: Returning to a neutral position (Steps 12-14):** This involves moving away from the stove to a safe and stable resting position. This final step ensures the robot is safe and ready for further instructions.
