## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bowl from a table and placing it inside the top drawer of a cabinet.  The bowl, along with other items (cream cheese, plate, wine bottle), was located on a table. A wooden cabinet with a wine rack was situated near the table. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to open the top drawer of the cabinet and deposit the bowl inside. The intended outcome was a successfully placed bowl within the open drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Cabinet:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could interact with the cabinet drawer.
2. **Open the Top Drawer:** (Steps 6-16)  The robot had to execute the necessary movements to open the drawer. This likely involved moving the arm to a position above the handle, manipulating the handle, and then holding the drawer open.
3. **Pick Up the Bowl:** (Steps 17-26) The robot had to locate and grasp the bowl. This phase involved navigating the arm to the bowl’s location, carefully grasping it using its gripper, and then lifting the bowl.
4. **Place the Bowl in the Drawer:** (Steps 27-34) The robot placed the bowl inside the open drawer. This required maneuvering the bowl towards the drawer’s interior, releasing the grip, and finally, retracting the arm to a safe distance.
