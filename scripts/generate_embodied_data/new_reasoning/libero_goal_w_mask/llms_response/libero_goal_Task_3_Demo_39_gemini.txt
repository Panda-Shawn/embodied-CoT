## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bowl located in the center of a scene and placing it inside the top drawer of a wooden cabinet.  The environment included a cabinet near a wine rack, a cream cheese, a wine bottle, a plate, the target bowl, and a stove, all situated on a table. The primary activity was manipulation, with the intended outcome being the bowl's successful placement within the drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet to reach the drawer.  This involved maneuvering through the scene, avoiding obstacles like the wine rack, cream cheese, bottle, and plate. (Steps 0-6)

2. **Open Drawer:** The robot then had to locate and open the top drawer of the cabinet. This required precise positioning of the arm to interact with the drawer handle. (Steps 7-14)

3. **Retrieve Bowl:** The robot needed to pick up the bowl from its central location on the table. This involved precise arm movement to grasp the bowl without disturbing other objects. (Steps 15-24)


4. **Place Bowl in Drawer:** Finally, the robot had to place the bowl inside the opened drawer and release it. This required a delicate release and positioning of the bowl inside the drawer. (Steps 25-26)
