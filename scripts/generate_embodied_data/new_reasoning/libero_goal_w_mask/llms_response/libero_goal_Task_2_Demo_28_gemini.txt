## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet near a stove, onto the top of the same cabinet.  The environment also contains a cream cheese, a plate, and a wine rack, all on the floor or table.  The primary activity is manipulation—grasping and repositioning the wine bottle. The intended outcome is the wine bottle's stable placement on top of the cabinet. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the Wine Bottle:** The robot needs to navigate to the location of the wine bottle on the cabinet. This involves a downward trajectory to position itself correctly.

2. **Grasping the Wine Bottle:** The robot needs to position its gripper around the bottle and secure its grasp.

3. **Lifting the Wine Bottle:** After securing the bottle, the robot lifts it slightly to allow for maneuverability during the repositioning process.

4. **Repositioning the Wine Bottle:** The robot moves the bottle to its final location, likely slightly adjusting the positioning for optimal stability.

5. **Releasing the Wine Bottle:** The robot opens its gripper to release the bottle onto the cabinet.

**High-Level Movements:**

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Wine Bottle  | 0-7        | To get into a position to grasp the bottle.                                       |
| Grasping the Wine Bottle     | 8-10       | Secure the bottle for lifting and moving.                                          |
| Lifting the Wine Bottle      | 11-15      | Raise the bottle to avoid collisions during movement and to reposition effectively. |
| Repositioning the Wine Bottle | 16-22      | Move the bottle to its desired location on top of the cabinet.                       |
| Releasing the Wine Bottle    | 23-25      | Release the bottle gently onto the cabinet's surface.                               |
