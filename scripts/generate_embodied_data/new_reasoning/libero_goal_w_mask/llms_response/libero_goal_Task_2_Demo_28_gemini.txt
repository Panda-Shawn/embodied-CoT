## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a wine bottle, located on a wooden cabinet near a stove, onto the top of the same cabinet.  The environment also contains a cream cheese, a plate, and a wine rack, all on the floor or table.  The primary activity is manipulationâ€”grasping and repositioning the wine bottle. The intended outcome is the wine bottle's stable placement on top of the cabinet. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the Wine Bottle:** The robot needs to navigate to the location of the wine bottle on the cabinet. This involves a downward trajectory to position itself correctly.

2. **Grasping the Wine Bottle:** The robot needs to position its gripper around the bottle and secure its grasp.

3. **Lifting the Wine Bottle:** After securing the bottle, the robot lifts it slightly to allow for maneuverability during the repositioning process.

4. **Repositioning the Wine Bottle:** The robot moves the bottle to its final location, likely slightly adjusting the positioning for optimal stability.

5. **Releasing the Wine Bottle:** The robot opens its gripper to release the bottle onto the cabinet.

**High-Level Movements:**

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Wine Bottle  | 0-7        | To get into a position to grasp the bottle.                                       |
| Grasping the Wine Bottle     | 8-10       | Secure the bottle for lifting and moving.                                          |
| Lifting the Wine Bottle      | 11-15      | Raise the bottle to avoid collisions during movement and to reposition effectively. |
| Repositioning the Wine Bottle | 16-22      | Move the bottle to its desired location on top of the cabinet.                       |
| Releasing the Wine Bottle    | 23-25      | Release the bottle gently onto the cabinet's surface.                               |
