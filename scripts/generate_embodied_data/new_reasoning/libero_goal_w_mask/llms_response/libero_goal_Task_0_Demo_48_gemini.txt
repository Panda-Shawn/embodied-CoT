## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved opening the middle drawer of a wooden cabinet located in an environment containing various objects: a wine rack (left), cream cheese (middle), wine bottle (near cream cheese), plate and bowl (together), and a flat stove (left). The cabinet is situated on the right. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to locate and open the middle drawer of the cabinet. The intended outcome was a successfully opened middle drawer.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** Steps 0-8. This involved navigating the cluttered workspace to position the robot arm appropriately before interacting with the cabinet. Justification: The robot needed to get close enough to the cabinet to reach the drawer.

2. **Locate and reach for the drawer handle:** Steps 9-13. This included precise movements to locate and grasp the drawer handle. Justification:  This is a prerequisite for opening the drawer; the robot arm must be positioned accurately at the drawer handle.

3. **Open the drawer:** Steps 14-17.  The robot executed the actions necessary to pull open the drawer. Justification: This is the final stage of the task, the actual opening of the drawer.
