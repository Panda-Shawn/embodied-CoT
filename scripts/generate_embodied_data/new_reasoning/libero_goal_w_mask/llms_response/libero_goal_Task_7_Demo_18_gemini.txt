## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on the stove.  The intended outcome is to have the stove switched on. The objects involved are the robotic arm, the stove (located on the left side of a table), and possibly a knob or switch on the stove. Other objects in the environment (wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, Akita black bowl) are irrelevant to the task. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the stove:** The robot needs to move its arm to a position close enough to the stove to interact with its controls.
2. **Locating and grasping the stove knob/switch:** The robot must locate the control mechanism (assuming it's a knob) and grasp it firmly with its gripper.
3. **Turning the knob/switch:**  The robot needs to rotate the knob to turn on the stove.

Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approaching the stove (Steps 0-5):**  The robot moves its arm towards the stove, adjusting its position and orientation. This is necessary to bring the arm into the correct proximity and angle to interact with the stove's controls.
* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasping the stove knob (Steps 6-8):** The robot positions its gripper above the stove knob and closes the gripper to securely hold the knob. This is crucial for the next step, turning the knob.
* **High-Level Movement 3: Turning the stove on (Steps 10-12):** The robot rotates the knob to turn on the stove.  This is the final step to complete the task.  The specific rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) depends on the stove's design.
