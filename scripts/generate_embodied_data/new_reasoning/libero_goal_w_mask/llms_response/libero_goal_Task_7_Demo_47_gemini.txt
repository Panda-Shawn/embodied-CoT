## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove. The primary activity was manipulating the stove's control knob to activate the stove's heating element. The intended outcome was a functioning, heated stove. The relevant objects were the stove (located on the left side of a table), and the robot arm itself.  Other objects present—a wooden cabinet, wine rack, wine bottle, cream cheese, plate, and Akita black bowl—were irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position close enough to the stove's control knob to interact with it. This spans trajectory steps 0-2.  This was necessary to bring the manipulator to a position for effective interaction with the stove knob.

2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot needed to grasp the stove's knob to be able to rotate it. This phase covered steps 3-6. Grasping was crucial to exert control over the knob during the rotation.

3. **Rotate the knob:** The robot had to rotate the knob to the "on" position. This encompassed trajectory steps 8. Rotation was the final action required to turn on the stove.

4. **Stop and Retract:** Once the knob was rotated and the stove was turned on, the robot needed to stop and retract. This spans step 7 and 9.
