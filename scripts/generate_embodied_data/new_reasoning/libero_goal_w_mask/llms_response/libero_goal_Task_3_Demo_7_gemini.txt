## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to open the top drawer of a cabinet and place a bowl inside. The environment contains a wooden cabinet with a wine rack (on the cabinet), a cream cheese, a wine bottle, a plate, and a bowl, all on a table. The cabinet is located to the right of the table.  The primary activity is manipulation: picking up the bowl and placing it in the drawer. The intended outcome is the bowl being successfully placed inside the opened top drawer of the cabinet.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the cabinet and bowl:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to position itself to reach both the cabinet and the bowl.

2. **Open the top drawer:** (Steps 3-15) The robot must reach the drawer handle, grasp it, and pull it open.

3. **Pick up the bowl:** (Steps 16-20) The robot must locate the bowl, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place the bowl in the drawer:** (Steps 21-24) The robot positions the bowl inside the open drawer and releases it.
