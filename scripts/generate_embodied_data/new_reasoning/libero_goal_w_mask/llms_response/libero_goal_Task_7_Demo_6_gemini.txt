## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to turn on a stove located on the left side of a table. The environment includes a stove, a wooden cabinet on the right side of the table, a wine rack near the cabinet, a wine bottle and plate on the table, a bowl containing cream cheese.  The primary activity is to reach the stove's control knob and rotate it to the "on" position. The intended outcome is a functioning stove, indicated by a visual or auditory cue (not explicitly defined in the setup).

The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory:

1. **Approach the stove:** The robot needs to navigate from its initial position to a position close enough to interact with the stove's knob.  (Steps 0-4)

2. **Grasp the knob:** The robot must grasp the stove's control knob using its gripper. (Steps 4-5)

3. **Turn on the stove:** The robot rotates the knob to the "on" position. (Steps 7-9)
