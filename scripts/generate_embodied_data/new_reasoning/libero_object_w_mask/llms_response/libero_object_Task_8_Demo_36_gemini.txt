## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, along with a basket. The pudding bottle was positioned such that the robot needed to move to it, grasp it, and then move to the basket to deposit it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to the location of the chocolate pudding bottle. This involved maneuvering around other objects on the floor.

2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-6) After reaching the pudding, the robot needed to grasp it securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport the Chocolate Pudding to the Basket:** (Steps 6-10)  The robot lifted the pudding bottle, moved it over to the basket, and positioned it above the basket.

4. **Place the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** (Steps 10-13)  The robot carefully lowered the bottle into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-15) The robot moved away from the basket after completing the placement.
