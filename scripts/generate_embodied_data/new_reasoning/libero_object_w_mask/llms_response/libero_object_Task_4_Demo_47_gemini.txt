## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contains several other condiment bottles (bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk) along with the ketchup and basket, all situated on either a table or the floor.  The exact spatial relationships between these objects aren't explicitly detailed, but the trajectory implies the ketchup is reachable without significant obstacle avoidance. The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the ketchup, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, and releasing it into the basket.

High-level movements identified from the trajectory:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 1-6. This involves maneuvering the robotic arm into a position above the ketchup bottle to prepare for grasping.  It is needed to position the gripper for successful pickup.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. This involves closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle. This is necessary to secure the ketchup for subsequent movement.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 8-9. This involves lifting the ketchup bottle clear of the surface it rests on. This step is crucial to allow for movement to the basket without dragging or bumping.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-12.  This involves moving the ketchup bottle towards the basket.  The trajectory suggests a relatively direct path. This is the main transport step to achieve the goal.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 12-15. This involves positioning the ketchup above the basket and releasing it. It's essential for successful task completion.
