## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a chocolate pudding from a basket on the floor and placing it back in the same basket. The environment contained several other items on the floor near the basket: orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The robot successfully navigated this cluttered environment to achieve its objective. The primary activity was the manipulation of the chocolate pudding, and the intended outcome was to return the chocolate pudding to its original location within the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements included:

1. **Approaching the Basket:** The robot needed to move itself into a position where it could reach the chocolate pudding in the basket.  This involved a series of movements towards the general location of the basket. (Steps 0-2)

2. **Picking up the Chocolate Pudding:** Once positioned, the robot needed to grasp the chocolate pudding.  This required lowering the gripper arm and carefully closing the gripper around the pudding. (Steps 3-4)

3. **Lifting the Chocolate Pudding:** After securing the pudding, the robot needed to lift it vertically, clearing it from the other objects on the floor. (Steps 5-7)

4. **Moving the Chocolate Pudding to its original location:** The robot had to then move the pudding to place it back into the basket. (Steps 8-13)

5. **Placing down the Chocolate Pudding:**  The robot needs to open the gripper to release the chocolate pudding and make sure it is placed properly. (Steps 14-18)
