## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the salad dressing bottle from a cluttered surface and place it into a basket on the floor. The environment includes a basket, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, and various other food items (alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce) located on the floor and a table.  The robot needs to navigate to the salad dressing, grasp it without disturbing other items, lift it, and then move it to the basket, placing it gently inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-5)  The robot needs to position itself close enough to the salad dressing to grasp it. This involves navigating around other objects.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-8) The robot must lower its gripper to the salad dressing and close the gripper to secure a firm grip.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 9-17)  The robot needs to lift the salad dressing bottle carefully without spilling it or knocking over nearby objects.  This may require precise movements and adjustments.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 18-23) The robot must maneuver to the location of the basket, avoiding collisions. This phase involves navigation in a potentially cluttered space.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 24-28) The robot must carefully lower the salad dressing into the basket, open its gripper, and then return to a resting position.
