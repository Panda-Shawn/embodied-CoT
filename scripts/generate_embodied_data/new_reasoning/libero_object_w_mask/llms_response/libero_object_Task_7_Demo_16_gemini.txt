## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was situated to the robot's right and slightly forward. The basket was located to the robot's left and slightly forward. The robot needed to navigate to the milk, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, placing it carefully inside.

The high-level movements identified are as follows:

1. **Approach Milk:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needed to initially position itself close enough to the milk carton to reach it with its gripper. This involved moving right, then forward and right, then forward, then further forward and down to be directly above the milk.

2. **Grasp Milk:** Steps 5-8.  With the robot positioned correctly above the milk, it needed to grasp the carton securely. This involved moving down and closing the gripper.

3. **Lift Milk:** Steps 10-11. Once the milk was grasped, the robot needed to lift it vertically clear of the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-12. The robot needed to move to a position directly above the basket.

5. **Place Milk:** Steps 12-16. The robot positioned itself above the basket and opened its gripper to place the milk carton inside.
