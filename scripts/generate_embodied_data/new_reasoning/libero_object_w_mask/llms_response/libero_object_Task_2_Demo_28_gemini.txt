## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several objects: a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, a carton of alphabet soup next to a carton of milk, and a carton of cream cheese next to the salad dressing. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully grasp the salad dressing bottle without colliding with anything and then place it in the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the salad dressing bottle. This involved navigating around other objects in the environment.

2. **Grasp the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-6) Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to lower its gripper to grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift and transport the salad dressing:** (Steps 7-11)  After grasping the bottle, the robot had to lift it and move it towards the basket.  This required careful maneuvering to avoid collisions.

4. **Position above the basket:** (Steps 12-14)  The robot then moved to a position directly above the basket, aligning itself to deposit the salad dressing.

5. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 15-16) Finally, the robot opened its gripper to release the salad dressing into the basket.

6. **Stop:** (Step 17) The task is completed.
