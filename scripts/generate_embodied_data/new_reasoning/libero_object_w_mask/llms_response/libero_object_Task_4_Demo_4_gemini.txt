## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle is located on a surface to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket is located to the left and below the ketchup.  The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the ketchup bottle.  This involves moving right and down.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 4-5)  The robot needs to close its gripper around the ketchup bottle.
3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needs to lift the ketchup bottle to a clear height above the surface.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-10) The robot moves to the basket's location.
5. **Place Ketchup:** (Steps 11-13) The robot opens the gripper to release the ketchup into the basket.
