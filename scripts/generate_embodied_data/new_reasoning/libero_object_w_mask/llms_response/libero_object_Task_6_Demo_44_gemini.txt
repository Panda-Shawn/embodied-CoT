## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it in a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was a two-stage transfer: first acquiring the butter, then depositing it into the basket. The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (on the floor).  The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it, navigate to the basket, and release it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the butter. This involved positioning itself above the butter.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 4-5. The robot needed to close its gripper to secure the butter.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-11. The robot needed to move from the butter's location to a position above the basket.

4. **Release Butter:** Steps 12-14. The robot needed to open its gripper to release the butter into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 15-16. The robot needed to move away from the basket to avoid interfering with the placed butter.
