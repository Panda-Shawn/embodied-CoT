## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the right and slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was positioned to the robot's left and slightly forward. The primary activity was the manipulation of the milk carton, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the milk carton from its initial position to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Approaching the milk:** The robot needed to move to a position directly above the milk carton to be able to grasp it. This involved moving right, forward right, and forward.
2. **Grasping the milk:** Once positioned, the robot needed to lower its gripper to pick up the milk. This included moving down and closing the gripper.
3. **Lifting the milk:** After grasping the milk, the robot had to lift it from the table.
4. **Moving to the basket:** The robot then needed to move the milk carton to the basket. This involved moving up, to the left and slightly forward, then lowering it over the basket to place it.
5. **Placing the milk:** Finally, the robot needed to carefully place the milk carton into the basket and then release it. This involved opening the gripper.


**High-Level Movements Breakdown:**

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approaching the milk | 0-3 |  The robot needed to position itself optimally above the milk carton to facilitate grasping.  This involved adjustments in both x and y coordinates. |
| Grasping the milk | 4-6 | This involved carefully lowering the robotic arm and activating the gripper to securely grasp the milk carton. |
| Lifting the milk | 7-8 | This high-level movement ensured that the milk carton was lifted and clear of the surface before initiating movement to the basket.  |
| Moving to the basket | 9-18 | This phase involved a coordinated movement to reposition the robotic arm carrying the milk carton to a location above the basket.  It involves navigating the space and optimizing the orientation for placement. |
| Placing the milk | 19-25 | This phase involved careful lowering of the robotic arm over the basket to avoid collisions, opening the gripper to release the milk carton, and concluding with a safe retraction. |
