## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket.  The environment included a wooden surface with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The BBQ sauce was initially located on the table, likely near other objects, and the basket was also on the table.  The robot's goal was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle without disturbing other items and place it inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the BBQ sauce. This involved moving forward and slightly adjusting its position to approach the target area.

2. **Pick up BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot needed to reach down, grasp the BBQ sauce bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-13) The robot needed to transport the BBQ sauce to the basket while avoiding collisions with other objects. This involved moving up to clear the sauce bottle, and then navigating towards the basket's approximate location.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 14-18)  The robot had to carefully position the BBQ sauce within the basket. This involved maneuvering to place the bottle properly and release its grip.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 19-20) The robot moved away from the basket to avoid accidental knocks or disturbances.
