## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce and placing it in a basket. The environment included a basket on the floor, a bottle of BBQ sauce adjacent to the basket, and several other condiment bottles (ketchup, salad dressing, cream cheese, and alphabet soup) arranged linearly next to the BBQ sauce. The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve this goal was:

1. **Approach the BBQ sauce:** The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the BBQ sauce.
2. **Grasp the BBQ sauce:** The robot had to precisely position its gripper to grasp the bottle of BBQ sauce.
3. **Lift the BBQ sauce:** The robot needed to lift the BBQ sauce from its resting place.
4. **Move the BBQ sauce to the basket:** The robot had to transport the BBQ sauce to the basket.
5. **Place the BBQ sauce in the basket:**  The robot needed to carefully position and release the BBQ sauce into the basket.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach the BBQ sauce (Steps 0-4):**  This involved positioning the robot arm close enough to the BBQ sauce to initiate grasping. The robot moved right, forward right, forward, and then down to reach the appropriate height.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasp the BBQ sauce (Steps 5-7):** This involved closing the gripper around the bottle. This involved stopping to ensure stability, followed by closing the gripper.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Lift the BBQ sauce (Steps 8-9):** This stage involved lifting the BBQ sauce upward for transport. The robot moved up, then left-up to achieve a clear trajectory.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Move to the basket (Steps 10-12):** This involved moving the BBQ sauce towards the basket.  The robot moved left, then further down to better position for dropping into basket.

* **High-Level Movement 5: Place the BBQ sauce in the basket (Steps 13-17):** This involved releasing the BBQ sauce into the basket. This involved moving down to insert the bottle, opening the gripper to release it, and then moving upward to a resting position.
