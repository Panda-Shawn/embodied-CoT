## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a container of cream cheese from a basket and placing it back into the same basket.  The environment contained a basket, cream cheese, and several other items (alphabet soup, milk, tomato sauce, butter, and orange juice) scattered on a table or floor. The cream cheese was initially located *inside* the basket. The robot needed to carefully navigate to the basket, grasp the cream cheese without disturbing other items, lift it, and then place it back in the basket. This seemingly redundant task likely served as a test of the robot's precision and ability to perform a delicate manipulation task.


The robot likely followed a plan comprised of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Basket:** Steps 1-4. The robot needed to initially position itself correctly before attempting to interact with the basket. This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the basket.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 5-8.  After reaching the basket, the robot had to accurately locate and grasp the cream cheese.  This stage involved precise movements and gripping actions.

3. **Lift and Retract:** Steps 9-10. The robot lifted the cream cheese slightly to clear any obstacles before retracting.

4. **Move to Placement Position:** Steps 11-13. The robot carefully moved to the desired placement location within the basket.

5. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-16. The robot opened its gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.

6. **Return to Stop Position:** Step 17. The robot returned to a default stopping position.
