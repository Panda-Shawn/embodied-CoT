## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The robot's task was to pick up a stick of butter and place it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce (including BBQ sauce and ketchup, which are next to each other), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding.  The butter's precise location isn't specified, but it's implied to be within reach of the robot arm.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot moves to the location of the butter.
    * Justification:  The robot needs to position itself correctly to grasp the butter.
2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 4) The robot closes its gripper around the butter.
    * Justification:  This is the essential action to pick up the butter.
3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 6-7) The robot lifts the butter.
    * Justification: This separates the butter from the surface and prepares for movement to the basket.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 7-10) The robot moves to the location of the basket.
    * Justification: This positions the butter above the basket for placement.
5. **Place Butter:** (Steps 10-14) The robot places the butter into the basket.
    * Justification: This completes the primary objective of the task.
