## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from the floor and placing it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contained several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce (presumably various types), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of bbq sauce. A bottle of ketchup was on a table.  The robot needed to navigate this cluttered environment to accurately grasp the butter without interfering with other objects and then deposit it in the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** This involved navigating to a position above the butter, avoiding obstacles.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the butter:** The robot needed to position its gripper accurately over the butter and close it to secure the butter. (Steps 4-5)
3. **Lift the butter:** The robot had to lift the butter from the floor to a safe height to avoid collisions. (Steps 6-7)
4. **Move to the basket:** The robot moved to a location above the basket while keeping the butter secure. (Steps 8-9)
5. **Place the butter in the basket:** The robot positioned the butter above the basket and released it. (Steps 10-12)
6. **Stop:** The task is completed. (Step 13)
