## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was initially located some distance from the robot and to the side of the basket.  The basket was presumably within reach of the robot after maneuvering.  The primary activity was manipulation of the bottle, requiring a series of movements to approach, grasp, lift, transport, and release the bottle. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bottle from its initial location to the basket.

High-level movements identified:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robot arm closer to the tomato sauce bottle, adjusting its orientation to prepare for grasping.  This was necessary because the robot initially was not positioned correctly to pick up the sauce.

2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** Steps 5-6.  This involved precise movement to position the gripper over the bottle and then closing the gripper to secure the bottle. This is the critical step that achieves the pick-up goal.

3. **Lift and transport the tomato sauce:** Steps 7-11. This involved lifting the bottle clear of the surface and then moving it to a location above and next to the basket. This is essential to position the bottle for placement in the basket.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 13-17. This involved moving the bottle above the basket, opening the gripper to release it into the basket, and then concluding the task. This completes the objective of placing the bottle in the desired location.
