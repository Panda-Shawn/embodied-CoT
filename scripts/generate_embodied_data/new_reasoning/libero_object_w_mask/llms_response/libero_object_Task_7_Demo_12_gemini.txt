## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially situated to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly above the robot's starting position. The robot needed to move to the milk's location, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket's location and release it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach for the milk:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needed to position itself correctly to grasp the milk carton.
2. **Grasp the milk:** Steps 4-5.  The robot needed to securely grasp the milk carton.
3. **Lift the milk:** Steps 6-8.  The robot needed to lift the milk carton clear of the surface.
4. **Move the milk to the basket:** Steps 9-14. The robot needed to transport the milk to the basket location.
5. **Place the milk in the basket:** Steps 14-17. The robot needed to position the milk in the basket and release its grip.
6. **Return to home position:** Steps 18-19. The robot could return to a neutral position.
