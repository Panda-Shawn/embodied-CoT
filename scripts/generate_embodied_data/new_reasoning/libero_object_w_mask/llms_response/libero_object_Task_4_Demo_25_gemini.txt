## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was located some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, pick it up carefully, and then move it to the basket, placing it gently inside.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 1-10) The robot needed to move to a position directly above the ketchup bottle, orienting itself appropriately to grasp the bottle.  This involved a series of movements to adjust its position relative to the ketchup.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 10-11) The robot needed to close its gripper around the ketchup bottle to secure its grasp.

3. **Lift and Transport Ketchup:** (Steps 12-19) The robot lifted the ketchup bottle, moved it to the basket, and then adjusted its position to be ready to place the bottle in the basket.

4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** (Steps 17-20) The robot needed to carefully place the ketchup bottle into the basket, ensuring it was secure.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 20-21) The robot moved to a safe position after completing the task.
