## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robot arm, and the basket is located at a different position, also within reach. The robot arm has a gripper capable of grasping the cream cheese container.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-8) The robot needs to move to a position above the cream cheese container, orient itself correctly, and then grasp the container.
2. **Lift Cream Cheese:** (Steps 9-12) The robot lifts the cream cheese container after securing a grasp.
3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 13-20) The robot moves the cream cheese container to a position above the basket.
4. **Place Cream Cheese:** (Steps 21-26) The robot places the cream cheese container into the basket and releases its grasp.

```

Note that steps 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 show inconsistencies with a logical plan.  A successful trajectory would not open the gripper prematurely or make unnecessary movements.  My annotations reflect the attempted actions but also point out the errors.
