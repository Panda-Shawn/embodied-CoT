## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned on a surface, requiring the robot arm to navigate to it. The basket was situated at a different location from the milk carton.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the milk:** The robot needed to move its arm to a position above the milk carton, preparing for grasping.

2. **Grasp the milk:** The robot had to lower its arm to pick up the milk carton and securely grasp it with its gripper.

3. **Lift and move the milk:**  The robot needed to lift the milk carton and move it to the location of the basket.

4. **Place the milk in the basket:** The robot needed to position the milk carton above the basket and release its grip.

5. **Retract the arm:** The robot needed to move its arm to a safe position, away from the milk and basket.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding steps:

| High-Level Movement       | Step Range | Justification                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the milk         | 0-3        | To position the arm for grasping.                                                    |
| Grasp the milk            | 4-6        | To acquire the milk carton securely.                                                 |
| Lift and move the milk    | 7-9        | To transport the milk to the basket.                                                  |
| Place the milk in the basket | 10-13      | To release the milk carton into the basket.                                             |
| Retract the arm           | 14-15      | To return to a neutral position after task completion.                               |
