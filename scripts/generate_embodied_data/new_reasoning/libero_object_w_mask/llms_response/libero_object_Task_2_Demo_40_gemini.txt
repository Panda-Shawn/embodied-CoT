## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up the salad dressing and placing it in a basket. The salad dressing was located on a wooden surface or table, near a basket. Other items present included ketchup (next to the salad dressing), alphabet soup (next to the ketchup), cream cheese (next to the soup), milk (next to the cream cheese), and tomato sauce (next to the milk).  The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing, grasp it carefully, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, placing it inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to position itself in front of the salad dressing to reach it. This involved moving forward and slightly adjusting position to approach the salad dressing from a suitable angle.

2. **Reach and Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 3-5)  The robot had to lower its arm, carefully grasp the salad dressing with its gripper, and ensure a secure hold.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-8) After successfully grasping the salad dressing, the robot needed to lift it without causing spills or dropping it. This required a controlled upward movement and possibly a slight repositioning.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-10) The robot had to navigate to the basket, which was nearby, while carefully maintaining its grip on the salad dressing. This step could have involved moving laterally and adjusting to avoid colliding with other objects.

5. **Lower and Place Salad Dressing:** (Steps 10-13)  The robot needed to position itself above the basket, carefully lower the salad dressing, and release it gently into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14) The robot completed the task and stopped its movement.
