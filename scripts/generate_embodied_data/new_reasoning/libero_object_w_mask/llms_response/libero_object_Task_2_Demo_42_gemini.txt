## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered countertop and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment included a basket, salad dressing, ketchup (both near the basket), alphabet soup, milk, cream cheese, and tomato sauce (the latter four grouped together, separate from the basket and condiments).  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the salad dressing safely deposited in the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements included: approaching the salad dressing, grasping the salad dressing, lifting the salad dressing, moving to the basket, and placing the salad dressing in the basket.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 1-7.  This involved navigating the robot arm towards the salad dressing bottle, accounting for obstacles and positioning the gripper for a successful grasp.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** Steps 7-8. This involved closing the gripper around the salad dressing bottle to secure it for transport.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** Steps 9-10. This involved lifting the salad dressing bottle vertically.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-13. This movement transported the grasped salad dressing to the basket's vicinity. It involved maneuvering around obstacles.

5. **Place Salad Dressing:** Steps 14-17. This involved precisely positioning the salad dressing bottle above the basket and releasing it.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 18-19.  This involved moving the arm away from the basket after successfully placing the salad dressing.
