## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it in a basket.  We assume the cream cheese is on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is also within reach, but in a different location. The robot needs to move to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, move to the basket, and then release the cream cheese into the basket.

We can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 1-5. This involves moving the robotic arm towards the cream cheese and positioning itself for grasping.  This is necessary to bring the arm into a position to interact with the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. This involves closing the gripper around the cream cheese to secure it. This is needed to pick up the cream cheese.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 7-8. This involves lifting the cream cheese from the surface. This is crucial to move the cream cheese away from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-11. The arm moves to the basket. This is necessary to bring the cream cheese to its destination.

5. **Position above Basket:** Steps 10-12. Fine positioning above the basket to prepare for placing.

6. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 12-14. This involves opening the gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.  This is the final action to complete the task.

7. **Retreat:** Steps 15-16.  The arm moves away from the basket after completing the task.
