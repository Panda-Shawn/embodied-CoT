### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contains a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce cartons. The salad dressing and ketchup bottles are positioned close to each other and near the basket. The other items are arranged in somewhat close proximity to each other, but not near the basket or the salad dressing.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-7)  The robot needs to navigate to the salad dressing bottle. This involves moving towards the general area where the salad dressing is located.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needs to precisely position itself above the salad dressing and grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-13) The robot lifts the salad dressing and moves it towards the basket.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 13-16)  The robot needs to position the salad dressing above the basket and release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) The robot moves away from the basket to conclude the task.
