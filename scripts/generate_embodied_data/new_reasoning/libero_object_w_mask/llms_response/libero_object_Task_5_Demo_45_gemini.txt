## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was initially positioned some distance from the robot and to the robot's right. The basket was further away from the initial robot position, possibly to the left of the sauce bottle.  The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it, and then move it to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** (Steps 0-4) This involved navigating to a position directly in front of the tomato sauce bottle.  This was necessary to position the arm for grasping.

2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 5-10)  This involved lowering the arm, closing the gripper around the bottle.  Accurate positioning was critical to successful grasping.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 12-18)  This involved lifting the sauce bottle, moving to a position above the basket, and orienting the bottle for placement.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 19-22) This involved lowering the arm, opening the gripper to release the sauce, and then moving away.
