## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it into a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other items: a ketchup bottle near the salad dressing and the basket, a carton of alphabet soup next to a carton of milk, a carton of cream cheese next to a carton of tomato sauce. The relative positions of these items are important for navigating the robot arm. The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing bottle, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the salad dressing bottle. This involved navigating around other objects to avoid collisions.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 5-6)  The robot needed to grasp the salad dressing bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 6-10) The robot had to lift the bottle and transport it to the basket, avoiding obstacles.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 10-14)  The robot needed to place the salad dressing bottle gently into the basket and release its grasp.
