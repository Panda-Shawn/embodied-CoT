## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket. The tomato sauce bottle was initially positioned somewhere within the robot's reachable workspace, likely on a table or counter. The basket was also within reach of the robotic arm, at a different location.  The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move to the basket to deposit it. The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 0-8) This involved moving towards the sauce bottle, adjusting orientation to get a good grip, and then closing the gripper to secure the bottle.  This was necessary to obtain the object for the task.

2. **Lift and Transport Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 9-13)  The robot lifted the bottle after grasping it and moved it towards the basket's general vicinity.  This was crucial to transfer the bottle from its initial location to the target location.

3. **Position and Deposit Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 14-18)  The robot precisely positioned the bottle over the basket, tilted to facilitate placement, and opened the gripper to release the bottle. This ensured the successful completion of the task objective.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 19-20) The robot moved away from the basket after placing the bottle.  This was a safety measure to ensure the robot did not interfere with the object again.
