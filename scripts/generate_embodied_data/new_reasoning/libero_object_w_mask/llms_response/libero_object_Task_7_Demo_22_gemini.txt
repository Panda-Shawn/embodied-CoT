## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a milk carton from a location on a surface and place it into a basket.  The milk carton is assumed to be positioned to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket is assumed to be positioned to the left and above the milk carton's location. The robot must execute a sequence of movements involving approaching the milk carton, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket's location, and releasing it into the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-2.  This is necessary to position the robot's gripper close enough to grasp the milk carton.
2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 2-3. This action is crucial to secure the milk carton for subsequent lifting and transport.
3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 4-6.  Lifting raises the milk carton to a safe height, preventing it from hitting the surface during transport.
4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-8. This transports the milk carton to the basket's location.
5. **Position above Basket:** Steps 8-9. This is necessary for precise placement of the milk carton into the basket.
6. **Release Milk Carton:** Steps 9-11. Releasing the milk carton deposits it into the basket.
7. **Retract:** Steps 11-12.  This is a final action to ensure the robot is clear of the basket and milk carton.
