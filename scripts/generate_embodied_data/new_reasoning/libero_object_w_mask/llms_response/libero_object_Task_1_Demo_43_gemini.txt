## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned elsewhere in the robot's workspace. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:**  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above and slightly in front of the cream cheese container.  This would allow the arm to reach down and grasp the container. (Steps 0-4)

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** This involved lowering the gripper and securely closing it around the cream cheese container. (Steps 5-8)

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** After grasping the cream cheese, the arm would lift it vertically to a position clear of the surface. (Steps 8-10)

4. **Move to Basket:** The arm would then move to a position above the basket. (Steps 10-12)

5. **Lower Cream Cheese:** The arm would then lower the cream cheese into the basket. (Steps 12-14)

6. **Release Cream Cheese:** The gripper would then open, releasing the cream cheese into the basket. (Steps 14-17)

7. **Return to Home Position:** Finally, the robot would return to a resting position. (Step 18)
