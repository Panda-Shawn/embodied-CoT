## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a stick of butter from the floor and place it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contained various other items on the floor: bottles of sauce (including tomato, orange juice, chocolate pudding, and BBQ sauce), a can of tomato sauce, and a bottle of ketchup on a table. The butter was situated amongst these items on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate this cluttered environment to successfully complete the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the butter, navigating around obstacles.  (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the butter:** This required precise positioning and gripping the butter with the gripper. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the butter:** This involved lifting the butter vertically from its position on the floor. (Steps 5-6)
4. **Move to the basket:** This phase involved navigating the arm to the location of the basket, accounting for the layout of the other items on the floor. (Steps 7-10)
5. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involved carefully positioning the butter within the basket and releasing it. (Steps 11-12)
6. **Retreat:** This final step ensured the robot arm moved to a safe position after placing the butter in the basket. (Steps 13-16)
