## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it in a basket located on the same floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, along with a basket. The pudding bottle was positioned such that the robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach it. The primary activity was the manipulation of the pudding bottle; the intended outcome was its successful transfer from the floor to the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Navigate to Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move to a position above the chocolate pudding bottle to be able to grasp it. This involved maneuvering around other objects on the floor.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 3-5) Once positioned, the robot needed to grasp the chocolate pudding bottle securely with its gripper.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 6-8)  After grasping, the robot had to lift the bottle to a clear height to avoid collisions with the floor and other objects during transportation.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 8-13) The robot needed to move the pudding bottle to a position above the basket, again avoiding collisions with other objects.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) Once positioned above the basket, the robot had to carefully lower and release the pudding bottle.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 16-18)  The robot moves away from the basket after successfully placing the pudding bottle.
