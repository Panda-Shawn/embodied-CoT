## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several other food items (chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese) scattered on the table besides the BBQ sauce and basket.  The BBQ sauce was initially located on the table near other items. The basket was also on the table.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needs to move to a position above the BBQ sauce to grasp it.
2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needs to close its gripper to secure the BBQ sauce.
3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 9-12) The robot needs to lift the BBQ sauce to a safe height to avoid collision with the table.
4. **Approach Basket:** (Steps 13-16)  The robot needs to navigate to the location of the basket.
5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 17-24)  The robot needs to lower the BBQ sauce into the basket and release it.
6. **Retreat and Open Gripper (Cleanup):** (Steps 25-28)  The robot needs to move away from the basket and open its gripper to finish the task.
