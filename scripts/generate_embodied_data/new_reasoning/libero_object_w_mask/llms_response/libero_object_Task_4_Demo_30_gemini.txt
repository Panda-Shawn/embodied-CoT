### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of ketchup and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface, requiring the robot arm to reach across a certain distance and potentially adjust its position to accurately grasp the bottle.  The basket was located at a different position, potentially requiring the robot to move the ketchup bottle to the basket location while avoiding obstacles.  The high-level movements necessary were:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 1-5. The robot needs to position itself close enough to the ketchup bottle to grasp it.  This involves moving to the appropriate location.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 5-9. The robot needs to close its gripper around the ketchup bottle and verify a secure grasp.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 9-12.  The robot must lift the ketchup bottle to a position clear of the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 12-14. The robot needs to move the ketchup bottle to the basket's location.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 14-16. The robot must release the ketchup bottle into the basket.
