## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it into a basket.  The BBQ sauce was initially located on the table amongst other items: chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate the cluttered tabletop to grasp the BBQ sauce without disturbing other items and then move it to the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-10)  The robot needed to move its arm into position to grasp the BBQ sauce. This involved navigating the cluttered table to approach the BBQ sauce's location.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 11-19) The robot had to lower its gripper to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle without knocking over other items.

3. **Move BBQ Sauce to Basket:** (Steps 20-28) The robot needed to lift the BBQ sauce and carefully move it to the basket, avoiding collisions with other objects.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket and Withdraw:** (Steps 29-31) The robot had to carefully position the BBQ sauce in the basket and then withdraw its arm, ensuring the BBQ sauce remains securely within the basket.
