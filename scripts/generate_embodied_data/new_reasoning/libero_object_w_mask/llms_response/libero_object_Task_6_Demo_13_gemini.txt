## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the floor to the basket. The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (on the floor).  The general sequence of high-level movements consisted of: approaching the butter, grasping the butter, lifting the butter, moving to the basket, placing the butter in the basket, and finally, returning to a resting position.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-3. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the butter to grasp it.  The robot needed to move into a position where its gripper could effectively engage with the butter.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 3-4.  This movement was crucial for securing the butter before lifting.  Closing the gripper around the butter ensured a firm grip to facilitate the subsequent lifting.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 5-7. This movement raised the butter off the floor, clearing it from any potential obstacles and preparing it for transport to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-11.  This movement involved transporting the grasped butter to the vicinity of the basket. The robot needed to relocate to the basket's location for the next stage of the task.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** Steps 11-14. This involved precisely positioning the butter above the basket and releasing it.  The robot carefully positioned itself for accurate placement within the basket.

6. **Return to Resting Position:** Steps 14-16. This final movement returned the robotic arm to its default resting state, completing the task.
