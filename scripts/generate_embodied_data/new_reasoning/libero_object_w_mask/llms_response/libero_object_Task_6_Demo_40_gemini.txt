## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket on the floor. The environment contained various items on the floor: a bottle of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of ketchup, in addition to the butter and the basket.  The robot needed to navigate this cluttered space to reach the butter, grasp it without disturbing other objects, and then move it to the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the butter, grasping it, lifting it, moving to the basket, placing the butter in the basket, and finally stopping.

Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 1-4. The robot navigates to a position near the butter, avoiding obstacles. This is necessary to reach the butter with its gripper.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 5-10. The robot precisely positions itself above the butter and closes its gripper to secure the butter.  This is crucial for successfully picking up the butter.

3. **Lift and Transport Butter:** Steps 12-14. The robot lifts the butter and moves it towards the basket. This step is essential for moving the butter to its destination.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** Steps 15-18. The robot moves to a position above the basket and releases the butter. This is the final step required to complete the main objective.

5. **Stop:** Steps 0, 11, 19. The robot stops at the start, between high-level actions, and at the end of the task.
