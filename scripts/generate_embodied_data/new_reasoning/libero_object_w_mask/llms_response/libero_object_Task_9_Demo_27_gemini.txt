## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle was located on a surface, requiring the robot arm to reach over to it. The basket was positioned some distance away and at a different height than the juice bottle.  The robot needed to navigate to the juice, grasp it, lift it carefully, navigate to the basket, and deposit the juice into the basket.

Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the Orange Juice:** Steps 1-4.  The robot needed to move towards the juice bottle to get into a position where it could grasp it.  This involved a series of forward movements, possibly adjusting its approach to account for the juice bottle's position.

2. **Grasp the Orange Juice:** Steps 5-8.  The robot needed to lower its gripper, approach the juice bottle and close its gripper to secure its hold.

3. **Lift and Move to the Basket:** Steps 10-12. The robot moved upward, lifting the juice bottle and initiating movement towards the basket.  It then adjusted its trajectory.

4. **Position Above the Basket:** Steps 13-14.  The robot made precise movements to position the juice bottle directly above the basket.

5. **Place the Orange Juice in the Basket:** Steps 15-17. This involved lowering the bottle into the basket and opening the gripper to release it.
