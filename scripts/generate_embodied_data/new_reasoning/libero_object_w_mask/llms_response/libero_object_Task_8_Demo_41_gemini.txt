## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a table or floor where it was situated amongst other objects (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and a basket) and placing it into the basket.  The primary activity was a two-phase manipulation: pick-and-place. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the chocolate pudding from its initial location to inside the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to the pudding, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and deposit it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Pudding:** Steps 0-4.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the chocolate pudding to grasp it. The robot needed to move to the general vicinity of the pudding before attempting to pick it up.

2. **Grasp Pudding:** Steps 4-5.  This movement was necessary to secure the pudding in the gripper, which requires both the precise movement to its location and the activation of the gripper itself.

3. **Lift Pudding:** Steps 5-7.  This phase involved lifting the pudding to clear it from the surface while keeping a firm grasp on it.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-10. This movement was crucial for transporting the pudding from its initial position to the basket. The robot had to precisely navigate around the other objects on the table.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 10-11. This involved positioning the pudding above the basket, creating a clear path for release.

6. **Release Pudding:** Steps 11-14. This required precise downward movement and opening the gripper to gently deposit the pudding into the basket.

7. **Retreat:** Steps 14-16.  This movement was necessary to avoid colliding with the pudding or basket after releasing it.
