## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from its initial position on the floor to the basket on the floor.  The objects involved were the butter and the basket. Their relative locations were both on the floor, requiring the robot arm to execute movements on a primarily horizontal plane.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** This involved moving the robotic arm towards the butter's location. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the butter:** This involved positioning the gripper above the butter and closing it to secure the butter. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the butter:** This involved raising the butter to clear the ground. (Steps 5-6)
4. **Move to the basket:** This involved moving the butter-holding arm to the basket's location. (Steps 7-10)
5. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involved lowering the butter into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 11-12)
6. **Return to rest position:** (Step 13)
