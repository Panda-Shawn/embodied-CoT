## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the robot's right and slightly forward. The basket was located further left and slightly behind the carton's initial position.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the milk carton:** This involved moving towards the milk carton's location. (Steps 1-3)
2. **Grasp the milk carton:** This included moving down to the carton's level and closing the gripper to secure it. (Steps 4-5)
3. **Lift the milk carton:** This entailed raising the milk carton vertically. (Steps 7-8)
4. **Navigate to the basket:** This involved moving the milk carton towards the basket, potentially making adjustments to avoid obstacles or optimize the path. (Steps 9-12)
5. **Place the milk carton in the basket:**  This involved lowering the milk carton into the basket and releasing the gripper. (Steps 13-17)
