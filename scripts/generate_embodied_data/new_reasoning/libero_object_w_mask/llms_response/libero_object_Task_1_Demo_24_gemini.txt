## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned to the left of the cream cheese. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket before releasing it.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robotic arm into position above the cream cheese.  This was necessary to get the gripper into a suitable position for grasping the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 5-6. This involved closing the gripper around the cream cheese to secure a hold. This was necessary to pick up the cream cheese.

3. **Lift and Rotate Cream Cheese:** Steps 7-8. This involved lifting the cream cheese and rotating it to a position suitable for transport to the basket. This was necessary to avoid obstacles and maintain a stable grasp during movement.

4. **Transport Cream Cheese to Basket:** Steps 9-11. This involved moving the cream cheese horizontally towards the basket.  This was necessary to move the cream cheese to its target location.

5. **Release Cream Cheese into Basket:** Steps 12-13. This involved opening the gripper and potentially lowering the cream cheese into the basket. This was necessary to complete the task.

6. **Return to Home Position:** Steps 14-17. This involved returning the robotic arm to its initial position. This is a standard post-task behavior to ensure the robot is ready for the next task.
