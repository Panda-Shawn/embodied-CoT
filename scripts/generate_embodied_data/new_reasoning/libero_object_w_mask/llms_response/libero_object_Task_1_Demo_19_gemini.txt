## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of cream cheese and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface, requiring the robot to approach it, grasp it, and then move it to the basket, presumably located at a different position.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal involves: approaching the cream cheese, grasping the cream cheese, lifting the cream cheese, moving the cream cheese to the basket, and placing the cream cheese in the basket.  Finally, the robot must stop.


The identified high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges and justifications are as follows:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach Cream Cheese            | 0-2         | The robot needs to position itself close enough to the cream cheese to grasp it.                              |
| Grasp Cream Cheese              | 3-5         | The robot needs to secure a firm grip on the cream cheese container.                                         |
| Lift Cream Cheese               | 6-8         | The robot needs to lift the cream cheese container to clear it from the surface.                              |
| Move Cream Cheese to Basket     | 9-11        | The robot needs to transport the cream cheese from its initial location to the basket's location.             |
| Place Cream Cheese in Basket    | 12-14       | The robot needs to carefully release the cream cheese into the basket.                                      |
| Stop and Finalize Action       | 15-16       | The task is complete, the robot must stop its movement and report its successful action                   |
