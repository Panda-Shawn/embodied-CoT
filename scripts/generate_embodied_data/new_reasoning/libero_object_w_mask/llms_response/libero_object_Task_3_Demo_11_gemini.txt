## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle from a table or floor near a basket containing other condiment bottles, and place it inside the basket.  The environment contained a basket on the floor, and several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and chocolate pudding) arranged nearby.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to grasp and transport the BBQ sauce bottle. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the BBQ sauce bottle inside the basket.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the BBQ sauce:** Steps 0-5. This movement involved navigating the robot arm to a position directly above the BBQ sauce bottle.  It was necessary to get the robotic arm into a position to be able to grasp the bottle.

2. **Grasp the BBQ sauce:** Steps 6-9. This involved lowering the gripper and closing it around the BBQ sauce bottle. This was essential to secure the bottle for transport.

3. **Move to the basket:** Steps 10-13. This stage involved moving the arm, now holding the BBQ sauce, to a position above the basket. This was necessary to position the BBQ sauce for placement.

4. **Place the BBQ sauce in the basket:** Steps 14-16.  This involved lowering the arm and opening the gripper to release the BBQ sauce into the basket.  This was the final step to complete the task.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 17-18. This involved moving the arm away from the basket after successfully placing the BBQ sauce.  This ensured the robot did not interfere with the basket's contents.
