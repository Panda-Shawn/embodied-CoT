1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located to the right and slightly down from the robot's starting position. The basket is located further away, requiring the robot to move forward after picking up the cream cheese. The general sequence of high-level movements involves approaching the cream cheese, grasping it, lifting it, moving to the basket, and then placing it inside.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

* **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 1-5. This movement is necessary to position the robot's gripper above the cream cheese.  The robot moves to the right and slightly down to reach the cream cheese.

* **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-10. This movement is crucial to pick up the cream cheese. The robot moves forward and closes its gripper around the cream cheese.

* **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 12-13. This movement lifts the cream cheese to clear it from the surface. The robot moves vertically upwards and slightly to the left.

* **Move to Basket:** Steps 14-16.  This movement transports the cream cheese towards the assumed location of the basket, the precise location of which is not specified.  This is likely implied by the trajectory.

* **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 17-24. This movement releases the cream cheese into the basket. The robot moves down, opens its gripper, and then moves upwards and away from the basket location.
