## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at a different location, also within reach. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the cream cheese, grasping the cream cheese, lifting the cream cheese, moving to the basket, and releasing the cream cheese into the basket.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm in proximity to the cream cheese for grasping. The arm moved forward and slightly downward to reach the cream cheese's location.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-12. This involved carefully lowering the arm, tilting the gripper upwards to align with the cream cheese's orientation, closing the gripper to secure the container, and pausing to ensure a secure grasp.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 13-17. The robot lifted the cream cheese and moved it towards the basket's estimated location.

4. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 17-22. The arm moved to the basket, lowered slightly, opened the gripper, releasing the cream cheese, paused, and then moved upward to clear the space.
