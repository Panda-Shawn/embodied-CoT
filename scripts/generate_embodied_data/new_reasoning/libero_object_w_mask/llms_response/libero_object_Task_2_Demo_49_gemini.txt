## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it in a nearby basket.  The environment included a white basket on the floor, a salad dressing bottle next to the basket, a ketchup bottle, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce cartons scattered around. The primary activity was manipulation of objects, specifically the salad dressing bottle, to achieve the intended outcome of having the bottle inside the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** The robot moved to a position where it could grasp the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** The robot grasped the salad dressing bottle using its gripper. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** The robot lifted the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 5-7)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot moved the salad dressing bottle over to the basket. (Steps 7-9)
5. **Position over Basket:** The robot lowered the salad dressing bottle above the basket. (Steps 9-10)
6. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** The robot released the salad dressing bottle into the basket. (Steps 11-12)
7. **Retract:** The robot retracted its arm. (Step 13)
