## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from the floor and placing it into a basket, also located on the floor.  Other objects present on the floor included bottles of sauce (likely various types), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of bbq sauce. Ketchup was on a table, irrelevant to the task. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to reach the butter and then the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the butter. This involves navigating around other objects on the floor to reach the butter's location without collision.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 4-5.  The robot needs to close its gripper around the butter.  This requires precise positioning above the butter before gripping it.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 6-9. The robot needs to lift the butter from the floor. The movement involves moving upwards and potentially tilting slightly to avoid obstructions or maintain a stable grip.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-12. The robot needs to move the butter to a position above the basket. This involves navigating around obstacles while keeping the butter securely held.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 12-13. The robot needs to position the butter directly above the basket, preparing for placement.

6. **Release Butter:** Steps 13-15. The robot needs to open its gripper to release the butter into the basket.

7. **Retract:** Steps 16-17. The robot needs to move away from the basket.
