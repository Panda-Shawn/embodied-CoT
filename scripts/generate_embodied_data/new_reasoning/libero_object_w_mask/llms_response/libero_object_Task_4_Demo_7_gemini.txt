## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface, likely a table or counter, and the basket was located some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing it inside. The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** This involved moving the robot arm towards the ketchup bottle, positioning it for grasping.  This phase encompasses steps 0-5.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** This phase included closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle.  This is captured in steps 6 and 7.

3. **Lift and Transport Ketchup:** After grasping, the robot lifted the ketchup and moved it towards the basket. This spanned steps 8-12.

4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** This final phase involved positioning the ketchup bottle above the basket, opening the gripper to release it, and then retracting the arm. This encompassed steps 13-16.
