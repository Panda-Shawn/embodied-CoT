## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from the floor and placing it in a basket, also located on the floor.  Other items present in the environment included salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce on a table, and butter on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needed to move to a position close enough to the alphabet soup to grasp it. This involved navigating around potential obstacles on the floor (like the butter).

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 6-8) The robot needed to position itself precisely above the alphabet soup and then close its gripper to secure the container.

3. **Lift and Transport Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 9-13) The robot lifted the alphabet soup and moved it towards the basket. The rotation (steps 12-13) suggests adjusting the orientation of the container to make the placement easier.

4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) The robot positioned the alphabet soup above the basket and released it.
