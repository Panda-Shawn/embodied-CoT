## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface to the robot's right and slightly forward. The basket was located to the robot's left and slightly behind the ketchup. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to position itself close enough to the ketchup bottle to be able to grasp it. This involved moving to the right and then slightly forward and down.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 5-8.  The robot needed to position its gripper around the ketchup bottle and close the gripper to secure it. This involved carefully moving down and closing the gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport Ketchup:** Steps 9-12.  After successfully grasping the ketchup, the robot had to lift it and move it towards the basket, maintaining a stable grip. This involved moving upwards and then towards the left.

4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 13-16.  Finally, the robot needed to precisely position the ketchup within the basket and release it. This involved moving downwards, opening the gripper, and stopping.
