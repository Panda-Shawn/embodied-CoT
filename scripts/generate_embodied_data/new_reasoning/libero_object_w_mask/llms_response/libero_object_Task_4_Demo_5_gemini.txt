## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located further away, to the left and slightly lower than the ketchup bottle.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and finally release the ketchup into the basket.

Based on the trajectory, the robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 1-6.  The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the ketchup bottle. This involves moving right, downward, and then backward to reach the optimum grasping position.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. The robot closes its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.
3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 8-9. The robot lifts the ketchup bottle from the surface.
4. **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 10-18. The robot moves toward the basket, possibly adjusting its orientation as needed.  The actions suggest the basket was partially obscured, requiring precise maneuvering.
5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 19-22. The robot positions the ketchup bottle above the basket and releases its grip.
