## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained, besides the butter and basket, several other items: bottles of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, and a bottle of orange juice, all situated on the floor along with the butter and basket. The floor itself served as the background.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself appropriately near the butter to be able to grasp it.  This involves navigating around the other objects on the floor to avoid collisions.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot needs to lower its gripper, precisely position it over the butter, and then close the gripper to secure a hold.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-11) After securing the butter, the robot needs to lift it and move it towards the basket.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 12-16) The robot needs to position itself above the basket and carefully release the butter into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-21) Finally, the robot needs to move away from the basket after successfully placing the butter to avoid interference.
