## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the transfer of the butter from its initial position to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the butter inside the basket.  The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (on the floor).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:**  (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the butter. This involved rotating and moving to align its gripper with the butter.
2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needed to pick up the butter using its gripper.
3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-17)  The robot needed to lift the butter, move it over to the basket, and lower it.
4. **Place Butter in Basket and Retreat:** (Steps 18-22) The robot needed to place the butter into the basket, release its grip, and then move away from the basket.
