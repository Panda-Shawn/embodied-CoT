## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a stick of butter from the floor and place it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce (various types), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of bbq sauce.  A bottle of ketchup is located on a table.  The robot must navigate this cluttered environment to successfully grasp the butter and place it in the designated basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 1-7. The robot needs to approach the butter, maneuvering around other objects to reach a position suitable for grasping it. This involves navigating the cluttered floor space.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 7-9.  The robot needs to accurately position its gripper over the butter and close it to secure the butter.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 10-11. The robot needs to lift the butter from the floor.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-14. The robot needs to move the butter to the basket while keeping it secure in the gripper. This involves navigating the cluttered floor space again.

5. **Place Butter:** Steps 14-17. The robot needs to position the butter within the basket and release it.
