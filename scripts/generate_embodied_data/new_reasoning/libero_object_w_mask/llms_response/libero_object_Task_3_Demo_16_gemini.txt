## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered countertop and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup) and a can of cream cheese, all arranged linearly on a surface. The basket was located on the floor near the condiments. The primary activity was manipulationâ€”specifically, picking and placing the BBQ sauce bottle. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the BBQ sauce bottle from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to position itself close enough to the BBQ sauce bottle to grasp it. This involved navigating to the area where the bottles were located.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8) The robot had to lower its gripper and close it around the BBQ sauce bottle. This required precise positioning and gripper control to securely grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-12)  The robot lifted the BBQ sauce bottle and moved it towards the basket. This involved a combination of vertical and horizontal movement.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-16)  The robot lowered the bottle into the basket and released its grip. Accurate positioning was crucial to prevent the bottle from falling or spilling.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) The robot moved away from the basket after completing the task.
