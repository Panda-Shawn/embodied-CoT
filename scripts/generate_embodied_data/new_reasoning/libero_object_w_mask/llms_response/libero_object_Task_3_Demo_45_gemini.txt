## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of BBQ sauce and place it in a basket.  The environment contains a basket on the floor, and several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup) and a can of cream cheese are arranged linearly on the surface next to the basket. The BBQ sauce is closest to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needs to position itself appropriately to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle.  This involves navigating to a location near the bottle.

2. **Pick up the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 4-8)  The robot lowers its gripper to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle.

3. **Move the BBQ sauce to the basket:** (Steps 14-16)  The robot moves the grasped BBQ sauce to the location of the basket.

4. **Place the BBQ sauce in the basket:** (Steps 17-24) The robot carefully places the BBQ sauce into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 26-27) The robot moves away from the basket.
