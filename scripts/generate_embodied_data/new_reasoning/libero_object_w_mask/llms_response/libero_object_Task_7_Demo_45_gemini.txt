## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and slightly forward of the robot arm. The basket was located to the left and slightly behind the milk carton's starting position. The primary activity was a manipulation task, the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the milk carton from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the milk carton:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the milk carton with its gripper.
2. **Grasp the milk carton:** (Steps 4-8)  The robot needed to position itself directly over the milk carton and close its gripper to secure it.
3. **Lift the milk carton:** (Steps 9-11) The robot had to lift the milk carton clear of the surface.
4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 12-16)  The robot needed to transport the milk carton to the location of the basket.
5. **Place the milk carton in the basket:** (Steps 16-19) The robot needed to position the milk carton above the basket and release its grip.
6. **Return to a neutral position:** (Steps 19-20) This step ensures the robot concludes the task in a safe and consistent state.
