## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects on the floor near the butter and the basket, including bottles of sauce (ketchup, BBQ sauce, orange juice, chocolate pudding), and a can of tomato sauce. The butter is located somewhat between these objects and the basket.  The robot needs to navigate around these obstacles to successfully complete the task.

The general sequence of high-level movements is as follows:

1. **Approach the butter:** The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the butter. This involves navigating around the other objects on the floor. (Steps 0-4)

2. **Grasp the butter:** The robot needs to position its gripper over the butter and close the gripper to secure the butter. (Steps 5-6)

3. **Lift the butter:** The robot needs to lift the butter from the surface. (Steps 7-8)

4. **Move to the basket:** The robot needs to navigate to a position above the basket. This again requires careful navigation around the objects. (Steps 9-11)

5. **Place the butter in the basket:** The robot needs to lower the butter into the basket and release its grip. (Steps 12-14)

6. **Return to a resting position:**  The robot concludes the task and returns to a stop position. (Steps 15)
