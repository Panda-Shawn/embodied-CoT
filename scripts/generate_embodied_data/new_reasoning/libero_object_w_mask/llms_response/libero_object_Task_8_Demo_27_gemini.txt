## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a table or floor, where it was situated amongst other objects such as orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup, and placing it into a basket.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the transport of the pudding. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the chocolate pudding inside the basket.  The pudding's initial position is unknown but assumed to be within reach of the robot arm. The basket's location is also initially unknown.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to initially position itself close to the chocolate pudding. This is necessary before it can attempt to grasp the object.
2. **Pick up Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 3-8) The robot needs to carefully maneuver its gripper to grasp the pudding. This requires precise positioning and gripper closure.
3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-13)  Once the pudding is grasped, the robot must move to the location of the basket.
4. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) After reaching the basket, the robot deposits the pudding inside. This involves precise positioning and gripper opening.
