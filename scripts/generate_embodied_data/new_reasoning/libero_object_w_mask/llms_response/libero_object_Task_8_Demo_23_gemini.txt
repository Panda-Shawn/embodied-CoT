## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a chocolate pudding from a basket on the floor and placing it in the same basket.  The environment contained several other food items (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) also on the floor, but these were irrelevant to the task. The basket's location was a key aspect of the environment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the basket:** This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the basket. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved reaching down to the basket, grasping the pudding, and lifting it. (Steps 3-6)
3. **Place the chocolate pudding in the basket:** This involved moving the pudding above the basket and releasing it. (Steps 7-16)
4. **Return to a resting position:** (Steps 17-21)
