## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained the butter, a basket, a bottle of ketchup, a bottle of BBQ sauce (both near the basket), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding, all situated on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate around these obstacles to reach the butter, grasp it, and then move it to the basket without knocking over any other items.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot moved to a position above and in front of the butter, navigating around the other objects on the floor. This required careful maneuvering to avoid collisions.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 5-9)  The robot lowered its arm, tilted its gripper to align with the butter, and closed the gripper to secure it.  This stage involved precise positioning and gripping actions.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-13) The robot lifted the butter and moved it to a position above the basket. This involved carefully lifting the butter to avoid dropping it and also positioning the butter above the basket to prevent spilling.

4. **Place in Basket:** (Steps 14-18) The robot lowered the butter into the basket and opened its gripper to release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 19-20) The robot moved its arm away from the basket. This was to prevent interference during operation and to enable future pick-and-place operations.
