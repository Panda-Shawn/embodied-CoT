## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a cream cheese container from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was initially situated somewhere within the robot's reach, requiring a sequence of movements to precisely locate and grasp it. The basket's location is also unspecified, but it was within reach after the robot moved with the cream cheese.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, and then move it to the basket, maintaining grip throughout the transfer.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-7.  This movement involved navigating to the cream cheese's location and securing a grip.  This was necessary to acquire the object required for task completion.

2. **Lift and Transport to Basket:** Steps 8-17. This involved lifting the cream cheese, potentially repositioning to navigate obstacles, and moving toward the basket. This phase was essential for transporting the grasped object.

3. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 18-26.  This involved precisely positioning the cream cheese within the basket and releasing it. This ensured successful task completion.
