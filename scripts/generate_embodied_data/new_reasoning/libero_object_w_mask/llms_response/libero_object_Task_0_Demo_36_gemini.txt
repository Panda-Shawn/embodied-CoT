## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The robot operated in an environment containing various food items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter. The precise spatial relationships between these objects are not fully specified, but it's assumed that the alphabet soup, basket, and the robot's workspace are positioned such that the robot can reach all three without significant obstacles.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 0-4) This movement involved navigating the robot arm to the location of the alphabet soup. This was necessary to bring the gripper into a position to grasp the soup.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 4-5)  This involved using the gripper to securely grasp the alphabet soup.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 6-10) After gripping the alphabet soup, the robot lifted it and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 10-13) This involved precisely positioning the alphabet soup over the basket and releasing it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-15) This involved moving the arm away from the basket after successfully completing the placement of the alphabet soup.
