## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a stick of butter located on the table and place it in a basket located on the floor.  Other items are present in the environment: bottles of sauce (likely ketchup, bbq sauce, and orange juice), a can of tomato sauce, all on the floor. The robot must navigate around these obstacles to successfully complete the task.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the butter:** Steps 0-8. The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the butter.  This involves navigating around obstacles on the floor and positioning its arm for a precise grasp.

2. **Grasp the butter:** Steps 8-9. The robot closes its gripper to secure the butter.

3. **Lift the butter:** Steps 9-11. The robot lifts the butter from the table.

4. **Move the butter to the basket:** Steps 11-15. The robot moves the butter, avoiding obstacles, towards the basket.

5. **Place the butter in the basket:** Steps 15-18.  The robot opens its gripper to release the butter into the basket.
