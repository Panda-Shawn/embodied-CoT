## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves picking up a stick of butter from the floor and placing it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of bbq sauce. A bottle of ketchup is on a table, which is irrelevant to this task. The robot must navigate around these objects to reach the butter, grasp it, and then move it to the basket without knocking over any other items.  The high-level movements necessary are:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the butter. This involves navigating around potential obstacles on the floor.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 4-5) The robot needs to close its gripper around the butter.

3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needs to lift the butter from the floor, creating enough clearance for maneuvering to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 7-10) The robot needs to move the butter to the location of the basket, again avoiding obstacles.

5. **Place Butter:** (Steps 10-13) The robot needs to open its gripper to release the butter into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-15) The robot moves to a safe position away from the basket.
