## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up an orange juice container from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The orange juice is assumed to be positioned on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is located at some distance and potentially at a different height.  The robot needs to navigate to the juice, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then carefully release it into the basket.

The trajectory suggests the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 0-3.  The robot moves forward and slightly to the right to approach the orange juice, positioning itself for grasping. This is necessary because the robot needs to be in close proximity to the target object to manipulate it.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 4-8. The robot lowers itself, adjusts its orientation, and closes its gripper to securely grasp the orange juice container. This is the critical step to successfully pick up the object.

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** Steps 9-12. The robot lifts the orange juice and moves it to the vicinity of the basket.  It needs to lift it to clear obstacles and transport it efficiently.

4. **Position above Basket:** Steps 13-14.  The robot moves to position the orange juice directly above the basket.  Precise positioning is needed to ensure successful placement.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 15-17. The robot lowers itself and opens the gripper to release the orange juice into the basket. This completes the primary goal of the task.

6. **Post-Placement Adjustment:** Steps 18-19. The robot may perform a final adjustment to ensure the orange juice is correctly placed.
