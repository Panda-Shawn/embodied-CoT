## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle is assumed to be positioned at a location reachable by the robotic arm, but not directly in front of it, requiring movement. The basket is assumed to be located at a different position than the sauce bottle.  The robot arm must navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, and then navigate to the basket to deposit the bottle.  The robot needs to avoid collisions and maintain a stable grip throughout the operation.

The trajectory suggests the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Sauce Bottle:** Steps 0-4.  This involves maneuvering the robot arm into a position to grasp the bottle.  This is necessary because the initial position of the arm is not directly over the sauce bottle.

2. **Grasp Sauce Bottle:** Steps 5-8.  This involves activating the gripper to secure the sauce bottle. This is obviously necessary to pick up the object.

3. **Lift and Transport Sauce Bottle:** Steps 10-11.  This involves lifting the sauce bottle and moving it towards the basket. This is needed to clear the sauce bottle from its original position.

4. **Approach Basket:** Steps 12-14.  This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to position the bottle above the basket. This is required to place the bottle into the basket.

5. **Deposit Sauce Bottle:** Steps 15-16. This involves opening the gripper to release the sauce bottle into the basket. This is essential to complete the task.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 18-19. The robot moves away from the basket.
