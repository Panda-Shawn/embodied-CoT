## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter.  The precise spatial relationships aren't fully described, but it's implied the robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach the soup and the basket.  The high-level movements were likely:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to position itself to grasp the soup container.  This involved navigating around other objects on the surface to reach the soup.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot had to move its gripper into a position to grasp the soup and then close the gripper to secure its hold.

3. **Lift Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 8-9) The robot lifted the soup container after securing a grasp.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot moved the soup to the basket, potentially navigating around other obstacles.

5. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 12-16) The robot positioned the soup container over the basket, opened the gripper to release the soup, and then moved away.
