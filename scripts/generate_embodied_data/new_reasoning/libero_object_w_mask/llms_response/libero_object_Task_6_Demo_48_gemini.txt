## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the butter from the floor and place it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment included several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce (types unspecified), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of bbq sauce.  Ketchup was on a table, irrelevant to this task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the butter. This involved navigating around other objects on the floor.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 4-5)  The robot needed to close its gripper around the butter.

3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 6-8) The robot needed to lift the butter, clearing the surface of the floor.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-10)  The robot needed to move the butter to a location above the basket.

5. **Place Butter:** (Steps 10-13) The robot needed to position the butter inside the basket and release it.
