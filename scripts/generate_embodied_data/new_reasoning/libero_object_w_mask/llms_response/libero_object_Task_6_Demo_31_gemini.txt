## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from the floor and placing it in a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contained several other items on the floor: bottles of sauce (types unspecified but including orange juice, chocolate pudding, and bbq sauce), a can of tomato sauce, and the butter.  Ketchup was located on a table, which is irrelevant to this task.  The robot needed to navigate around these obstacles to reach the butter, grasp it, and then navigate to the basket to deposit it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to maneuver itself to a position where it could grasp the butter.  This involved navigating around potential obstacles on the floor.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Step 5) The robot needed to close its gripper to secure the butter.

3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot needed to lift the butter from the floor, clearing any potential obstacles during the lift.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-17) The robot needed to move the butter to the basket's location, carefully avoiding collisions with objects on the floor. This involved maneuvering around obstacles and adjusting its orientation.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 18-20) The robot needed to lower the butter into the basket and release its grip.

6. **Return to Stop:** (Step 21) The robot stopped after completing the task.
