## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the alphabet soup (assuming "alphabet soup" was a typo and it meant to say "milk" as stated in the environment description) and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several objects on a wooden surface: milk, a basket, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter.  The spatial relationships between these objects are not precisely defined, but we can infer their relative positions based on the robot's trajectory.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the milk:** The robot moved towards the milk container.
2. **Grasp the milk:** The robot reached the milk and closed its gripper to secure it.
3. **Lift the milk:** The robot lifted the milk container.
4. **Move to the basket:** The robot moved the milk container towards the basket.
5. **Place the milk:** The robot positioned the milk container above the basket and opened its gripper to release it.


The high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps are as follows:

* **Approach the milk:** Steps 0-3.  This movement was necessary to bring the robot's gripper into a position where it could grasp the milk.
* **Grasp the milk:** Steps 3-4. This involved positioning the gripper precisely over the milk and closing it to achieve a secure grip.
* **Lift the milk:** Steps 4-6. This was essential to raise the milk container clear of the surface.
* **Move to the basket:** Steps 6-12. The robot navigated around other objects to reach the basket.
* **Place the milk:** Steps 12-15. This involved positioning the milk above the basket and releasing it.
