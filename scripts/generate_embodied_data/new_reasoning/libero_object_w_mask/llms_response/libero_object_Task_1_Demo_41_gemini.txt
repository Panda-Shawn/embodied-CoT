### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface somewhat in front of and to the right of the robot's starting position. The basket was located further away, to the left and slightly behind the starting position of the robot.  The high-level movements required were:

1. **Approach the cream cheese:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the cream cheese.  This involved moving forward and slightly to the right to approach the target object.

2. **Pick up the cream cheese:** (Steps 4-9)  This involved positioning the robotic arm above the cream cheese, lowering it down, rotating to align with the cream cheese, and closing the gripper to grasp it.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 10-15)  This stage involved lifting the cream cheese and moving to the basket's location.

4. **Place the cream cheese in the basket:** (Steps 16-20) This involved carefully positioning the arm above the basket, lowering the cream cheese, opening the gripper to release it, and finally withdrawing the arm.

5. **Stop:** (Steps 20-21) The robot completes the task.
