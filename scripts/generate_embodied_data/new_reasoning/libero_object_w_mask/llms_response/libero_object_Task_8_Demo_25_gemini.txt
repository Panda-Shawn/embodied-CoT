1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, and a basket also on the floor. The bottles were not interacting with each other.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the chocolate pudding bottle. The intended outcome was to have the chocolate pudding bottle successfully transferred from its initial position on the floor to inside the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the chocolate pudding:**  This involved navigating the robot arm to a position near the chocolate pudding bottle. (Steps 1-4)
2. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved moving the robot arm to grasp the bottle and close the gripper. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Move to the basket:**  This involved moving the robot arm carrying the chocolate pudding bottle to the location of the basket. (Steps 9-12)
4. **Place the chocolate pudding in the basket:** This involved positioning the bottle above the basket and releasing it by opening the gripper. (Steps 12-15)
5. **Retreat:** This involved moving the robot arm away from the basket. (Steps 17-18)
