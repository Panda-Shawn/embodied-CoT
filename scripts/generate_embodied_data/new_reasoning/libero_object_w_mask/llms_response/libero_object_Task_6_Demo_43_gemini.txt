## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained the butter, a basket, a bottle of ketchup, a bottle of bbq sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding, all situated on the floor. The ketchup and bbq sauce were near the basket.  The primary activity was manipulation—specifically, grasping and transporting the butter. The intended outcome was the butter’s successful transfer from its initial location to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to the butter's location, avoiding obstacles. This involved maneuvering around other items on the floor to reach the butter's position.

2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 5-6) Once positioned above the butter, the robot needed to grasp it securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and move to the basket:** (Steps 7-11) After grasping the butter, the robot had to lift it and move it towards the basket, again carefully avoiding collisions with other objects.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 12-14)  The robot had to position the butter above the basket and release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 15-16)  After placing the butter in the basket, the robot would retreat to a safe position.
