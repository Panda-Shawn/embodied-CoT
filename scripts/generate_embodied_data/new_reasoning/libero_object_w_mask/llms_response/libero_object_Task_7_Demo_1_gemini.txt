## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and place it into a basket.  We assume the milk carton is situated on a surface to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position, and the basket is to the left and slightly above the robot's ending position. The robot needs to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing it into the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements is:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** The robot needs to position itself above the milk carton to grasp it. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** The robot needs to close its gripper around the milk carton. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift Milk Carton:** The robot needs to lift the milk carton vertically. (Steps 6-10)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot needs to move the milk carton to a position above the basket. (Steps 10-13)
5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** The robot needs to lower the milk carton into the basket and release it. (Steps 13-17)
