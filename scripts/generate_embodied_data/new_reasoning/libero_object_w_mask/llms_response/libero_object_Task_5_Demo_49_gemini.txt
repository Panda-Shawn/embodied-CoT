## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The sauce bottle was initially positioned somewhat in front of and slightly to the side of the robot's starting position. The basket was located further away, likely to the left and slightly forward of the bottle. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it carefully without damaging it, lift it, move to the basket, and carefully place the bottle inside.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-4. The robot needs to move closer to the tomato sauce bottle to reach it with its gripper.
2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** Steps 5-7. The robot needs to position its gripper correctly above the sauce bottle and then close the gripper to secure a hold on it.
3. **Lift the tomato sauce:** Steps 8-10. Once grasped, the robot has to lift the bottle.
4. **Move to the basket:** Steps 10-12. The robot now must travel from the bottle's location to the basket.
5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 13-17. The robot needs to position the bottle precisely over the basket and then release it.
