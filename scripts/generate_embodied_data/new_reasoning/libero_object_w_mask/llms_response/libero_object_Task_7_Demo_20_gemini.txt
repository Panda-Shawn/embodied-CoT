## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the robot's right and slightly forward. The basket was located to the robot's left and slightly forward of the milk carton's initial position. The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robot arm to a position above the milk carton, preparing for grasping.
    * Justification: This movement was necessary to position the robot arm in close proximity to the milk carton before attempting to pick it up.  This minimizes the likelihood of errors during the grasping phase.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 5-6. This involved lowering the robotic arm and closing the gripper to secure the milk carton.
    * Justification: This was crucial for picking up the milk carton successfully. The downward movement ensures the gripper can properly enclose the carton.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-10. This stage involved raising the grasped milk carton and moving it to a position above the basket.
    * Justification: Lifting the milk carton is necessary to clear it from the surface and to allow for unobstructed movement towards the basket. Moving above the basket prepares for placement.

4. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 11-14. This stage involved lowering the arm and opening the gripper to deposit the milk carton into the basket.
    * Justification: This is the goal of the operation. The lowering and opening of the gripper ensures the milk carton is properly released into the basket.

5. **Return to Resting Position:** Steps 15. This final step involved the robot reaching a final resting state.
    * Justification: This indicates the completion of the task and puts the robot into a safe and neutral state.
