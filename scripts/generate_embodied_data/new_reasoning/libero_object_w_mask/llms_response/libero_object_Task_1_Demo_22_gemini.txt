### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was also within the arm's operational space. The relative positions of the cream cheese and the basket are not explicitly given, but the trajectory suggests the basket was to the left and possibly slightly higher than the cream cheese.

The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the cream cheese:** The robot needed to move its arm to a position above and close to the cream cheese container.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the cream cheese:** The robot needed to lower its arm and close its gripper to securely grasp the container. (Steps 4-5)
3. **Lift the cream cheese:** The robot needed to raise the arm, holding the cream cheese, to clear the surface. (Steps 6-8)
4. **Move to the basket:** The robot needed to move the arm holding the cream cheese to a position above the basket. (Steps 8-10)
5. **Place the cream cheese in the basket:** The robot needed to lower the arm, open the gripper, and release the cream cheese into the basket. (Steps 10-12)
6. **Retreat:** The robot needed to lift the arm clear of the basket. (Steps 13-15)
