## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it in a basket.  The orange juice is assumed to be on a surface, and the basket is located elsewhere in the workspace. The robot needs to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it into the basket. This involves a sequence of movements including reaching, grasping, lifting, transporting, and releasing.


The likely high-level movements are:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needs to move to a position above the orange juice bottle to prepare for grasping.  This involves maneuvering around obstacles or adjusting its position to optimize grasping conditions.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 4-7) The robot must carefully lower its gripper and close it around the bottle, ensuring a secure grasp.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** (Steps 8-10) Once the orange juice is grasped, the robot needs to lift it vertically, clear of the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-16) The robot must navigate to the basket, potentially involving turns and adjustments to its orientation to approach the basket optimally.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 17-20) The robot must carefully position the orange juice over the basket, then open its gripper to release the bottle into the basket.
