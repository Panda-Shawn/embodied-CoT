## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contained a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, and several other food items (alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce) scattered on the floor and a table.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the salad dressing bottle successfully transferred from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move into position to grasp the salad dressing bottle. This involved navigating to the area where the bottle was located.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 5-6) The robot had to accurately grasp the salad dressing bottle using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport to Basket:** (Steps 6-10)  The robot needed to lift the grasped bottle and move it to the basket's vicinity.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 10-14) The robot needed to carefully place the salad dressing bottle inside the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14) The robot moved away from the basket to avoid any collisions
