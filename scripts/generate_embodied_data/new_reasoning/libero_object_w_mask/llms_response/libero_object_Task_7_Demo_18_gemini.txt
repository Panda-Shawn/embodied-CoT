## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly behind the milk carton. The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and finally, place the milk carton inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to move into position to grasp the milk carton. This involved moving right and forward to reach the carton's general vicinity.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 5-8.  The robot needed to position its gripper over the milk carton and close it to secure a grip. This required precise downward movement and gripper closure.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 9-10. Once grasped, the robot lifted the milk carton.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 11-16. The robot needed to move the milk carton to the basket. This involved moving left, potentially adjusting its orientation (counterclockwise rotation).


5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 17-20.  The robot placed the milk carton in the basket, requiring opening the gripper and then moving away.
