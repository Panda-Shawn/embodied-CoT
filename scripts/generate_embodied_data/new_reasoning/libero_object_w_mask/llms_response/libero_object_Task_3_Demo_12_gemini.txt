## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a location within a basket and placing it in a separate, designated basket.  The environment contained a variety of food items (BBQ sauce, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese) scattered on a table or floor.  The target BBQ sauce was initially inside the basket, so the task involved picking it up from within a container.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the basket:** Steps 0-2: The robot navigates to the basket containing the BBQ sauce.  This is necessary because the robot must be positioned correctly to interact with the basket and the sauce bottle.

2. **Pick up the BBQ sauce:** Steps 3-7:  The robot reaches down, grasps the BBQ sauce bottle from within the basket, and lifts it slightly. This is the core of the task, involving precise manipulation and gripping.

3. **Move to the destination basket:** Steps 8-14: The robot moves to the target basketâ€™s location.  This is needed to place the sauce in the correct location.

4. **Place the BBQ sauce:** Steps 14-18:  The robot places the BBQ sauce into the designated basket and releases its grip. This completes the task objective.
