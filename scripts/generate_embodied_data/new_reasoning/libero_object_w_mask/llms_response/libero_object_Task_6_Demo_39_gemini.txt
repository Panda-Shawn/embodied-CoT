## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a stick of butter from a cluttered countertop and place it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained, besides the butter and basket, several bottles and a can: sauce bottles, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding. The ketchup bottle was next to the basket, and the bbq sauce bottle was nearby as well. The robot needed to navigate around these obstacles to reach the butter, grasp it, lift it, maneuver it through the cluttered space, and finally deposit it into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach the butter:** This involved navigating around the various items on the countertop to reach the location of the butter. (Steps 1-6)
2. **Grasp the butter:** This involved positioning the gripper above the butter and closing the gripper to secure it. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the butter:** The robot lifted the butter from the countertop. (Steps 7-8)
4. **Maneuver to the basket:** This involved navigating around the obstacles on the countertop and floor while avoiding collisions and maintaining a stable grasp on the butter. (Steps 9-17)
5. **Position over basket:** The robot precisely positioned itself directly above the basket. (Steps 11-17)
6. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involved opening the gripper to release the butter into the basket. (Steps 18-20)
7. **Retreat:**  The robot moved away from the basket after dropping the butter. (Steps 21-24)
