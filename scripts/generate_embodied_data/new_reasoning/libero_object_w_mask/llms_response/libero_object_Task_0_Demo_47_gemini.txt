## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to pick up the alphabet soup and place it in the basket.  The environment contained several objects on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter.  The relative positions of these objects are not explicitly given, but we can infer their positions based on the robot's actions. The basket's location is assumed to be reachable after the robot picks up the soup.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Alphabet Soup:**  (Steps 1-6) The robot moves towards the alphabet soup and grasps it with its gripper.

2. **Lift Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 7-9) The robot lifts the alphabet soup.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-24) The robot navigates to the basket. The movement to the basket implies some maneuvering around obstacles which is not precisely stated in the task description.

4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 25-29) The robot carefully places the alphabet soup into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 30) The robot stops after completing the task.
