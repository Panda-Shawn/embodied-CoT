## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The robot operated in an environment containing several other objects: a ketchup bottle, a milk carton, a cream cheese carton, and an alphabet soup carton, all positioned on the floor near the basket. The salad dressing and ketchup bottles were positioned close to the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the salad dressing bottle.  This involved moving forward and adjusting its position to be directly above the salad dressing bottle.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-7)  The robot needed to lower its arm, grasp the salad dressing bottle, and secure its grip.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 8-12) The robot then needed to transport the salad dressing to the basket while maintaining a stable grasp. This likely involved lifting the bottle, repositioning itself appropriately and moving the bottle to position it for placement.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 13-15) The robot needed to carefully place the salad dressing bottle inside the basket.  This required opening the gripper to release the bottle.

5. **Return to a neutral position:** (Steps 16-17) The robot completes the task by moving to a neutral or resting position.
