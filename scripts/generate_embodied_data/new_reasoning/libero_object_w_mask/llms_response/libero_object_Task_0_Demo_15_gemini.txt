## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere. The primary activity was manipulation of the soup container, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the soup container. This involved moving towards the general area of the soup.

2. **Grasp the Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 6-7) The robot had to close its gripper around the soup container to securely hold it.

3. **Lift the Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 8-10) The robot needed to lift the soup container vertically to clear it from the table.

4. **Move to the Basket:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needed to move the soup container to the location of the basket.

5. **Place the Alphabet Soup in the Basket:** (Steps 14-18)  The robot had to position the soup container above the basket and release it.
