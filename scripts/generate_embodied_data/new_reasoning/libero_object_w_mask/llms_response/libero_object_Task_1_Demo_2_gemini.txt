## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it into a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be positioned on a surface within reach of the robot arm, and the basket is located at a different position also within reach. The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket, carefully depositing it inside.

The high-level movements are as follows:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4. The robot needs to move into a position where it can grasp the cream cheese.  This involves navigating around obstacles (implied) and positioning its gripper appropriately.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 5-7.  The robot needs to close its gripper around the cream cheese, ensuring a secure grip.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** Steps 8-11. The robot lifts the cream cheese and moves it toward the basket.  This involves carefully avoiding obstacles and maintaining a stable hold on the container.

4. **Position over Basket:** Steps 12-13. The robot carefully positions the cream cheese above the basket, preparing to release it.

5. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-17.  The robot opens its gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.
