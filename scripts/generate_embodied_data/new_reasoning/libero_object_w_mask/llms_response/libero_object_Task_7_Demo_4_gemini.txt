## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The milk carton is assumed to be positioned somewhat to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket is located further to the left and possibly lower than the milk's starting position. The robot needs to navigate to the milk, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the milk:** Steps 0-4.  This movement is necessary to position the robot's gripper arm close enough to the milk carton to grasp it.  The robot needs to move into a suitable position to pick up the milk.
2. **Grasp the milk:** Steps 5-7. This movement involves positioning the gripper accurately over the milk and closing the gripper to secure a hold. The robot must precisely position itself to grasp the object.
3. **Lift the milk:** Steps 8-9. This is crucial for picking up the milk and clearing it from the surface. The robot must lift the milk in a stable and controlled manner.
4. **Move to the basket:** Steps 10-13. This involves repositioning the robot and the grasped milk carton to the location of the basket. The robot must navigate the environment avoiding obstacles and ensuring that the milk is not spilled.
5. **Place the milk in the basket:** Steps 14-16. This involves placing the milk in the basket precisely, followed by releasing the grip. The robot must carefully open the gripper and not drop the milk.
