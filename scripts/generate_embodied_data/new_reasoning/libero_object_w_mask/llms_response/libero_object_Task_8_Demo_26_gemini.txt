1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it into a basket located on the same floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, and a basket also on the floor. The bottles were not interacting with each other. The primary activity was the manipulation of the chocolate pudding bottle, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial position to the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to maneuver itself to a position where it can reach the chocolate pudding bottle.
2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 3-4) The robot needs to grasp the bottle securely using its gripper.
3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 5-7) The robot needs to lift the chocolate pudding bottle to a safe height to avoid collisions.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-11) The robot needs to move the chocolate pudding bottle towards the basket's location.
5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 12-13) The robot needs to carefully release the chocolate pudding bottle into the basket.
6. **Return to home position**: (Steps 14-16) The robot will return to its starting position.
