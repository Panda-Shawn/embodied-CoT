## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket. The orange juice bottle was initially positioned at some distance from the robot and the basket. The basket was likely placed to the left and slightly behind the orange juice, relative to the robot's starting position.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the orange juice:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to move to a position close enough to the orange juice bottle to grasp it. This involved navigating any obstacles and positioning itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp the orange juice:** (Steps 5-8) Once close, the robot had to accurately reach the orange juice bottle and grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Lift the orange juice:** (Steps 9-10) After securing the grip, it lifted the bottle.

4. **Transport the orange juice to the basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot then moved the grasped orange juice to the basket. The movement to the left suggests the basket was located to the robot's left.

5. **Position above the basket:** (Steps 15-16)  The robot positioned itself directly above the basket to accurately place the bottle.

6. **Place the orange juice in the basket:** (Steps 16-18) Finally, the robot released the grip, placing the bottle of orange juice into the basket.
