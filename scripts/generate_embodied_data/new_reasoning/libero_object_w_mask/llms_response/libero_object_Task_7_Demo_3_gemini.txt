## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was positioned to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located further away, requiring movement to the left and possibly requiring a change in height.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the milk:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the milk carton. This involved navigating to the correct location relative to the milk carton.

2. **Grasp the milk:** (Steps 4-6)  Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to close its gripper to securely grasp the milk carton.

3. **Lift the milk:** (Steps 7-9) After grasping the milk, the robot had to lift it off the surface.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot needed to move the milk carton, holding it securely, to a position above the basket.

5. **Place the milk in the basket:** (Steps 11-14)  The robot needed to lower the milk carton into the basket and release it.

6. **Return to home position:** (Steps 14-15) The robot ends its task by returning to an idle/home state.
