## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it in a basket, also located on the same surface.  Other objects—bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk—are present on the surface, but are not relevant to the task. The primary activity is manipulation of the ketchup bottle, requiring precise movements to grasp and transport it without disturbing the other objects.  The intended outcome is the ketchup bottle successfully placed inside the basket.


The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach and Grasp Ketchup** (Steps 1-7)
    * **Justification:** This movement is necessary to position the robotic arm correctly to grasp the ketchup bottle.  It involves navigating around potential obstacles and precisely positioning the gripper over the bottle.
* **High-Level Movement 2: Lift and Transport Ketchup** (Steps 8-12)
    * **Justification:**  This movement lifts the ketchup bottle after grasping it and transports it towards the basket.  It needs to be done carefully to maintain a stable grasp and avoid spillage or collision.
* **High-Level Movement 3: Place Ketchup in Basket** (Steps 13-17)
    * **Justification:** This movement is required to position the ketchup bottle accurately within the basket. It involves lowering the bottle carefully to avoid dropping it.
* **High-Level Movement 4: Retract and Stop** (Steps 18)
    * **Justification:** This concludes the task with the robot moving to a safe and stopped position.
