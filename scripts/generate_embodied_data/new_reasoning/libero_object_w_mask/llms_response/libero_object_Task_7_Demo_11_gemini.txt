## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and somewhat below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and somewhat below the robot's initial position. The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach and Grasp Milk:**  Steps 0-6. The robot needs to move to the location of the milk carton and grasp it securely.

2. **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 7-10.  The robot lifts the milk carton after successfully gripping it and moves it away from the original position.

3. **Move to Basket Location:** Steps 11-17. The robot transports the milk carton to the location of the basket.

4. **Place Milk in Basket:** Steps 18-23. The robot carefully places the milk carton in the basket and then stops.
