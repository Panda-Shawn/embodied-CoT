## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a table and placing it into a basket located on the floor. The environment included several other food items: milk, butter, orange juice, chocolate pudding, and BBQ sauce, all positioned on a surface near the basket. The tomato sauce's exact location is not specified, but it was among these other items.  The basket was on the floor, and the other items were arranged linearly next to each other and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needs to navigate to the general vicinity of the tomato sauce. This involves moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the area where the sauce is located.
2. **Lower Arm and Grasp Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 6-9) The robot lowers its arm to reach the tomato sauce and closes its gripper to grasp the bottle.
3. **Lift Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 11-12) The robot raises its arm, lifting the tomato sauce.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 13-15)  The robot moves horizontally towards the basket, potentially adjusting its position to account for the basket's location.
5. **Lower Arm and Place Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 15-17) The robot lowers its arm to place the sauce into the basket and opens its gripper to release it.
6. **Retreat:** (Steps 19-20) The robot moves away from the basket.
