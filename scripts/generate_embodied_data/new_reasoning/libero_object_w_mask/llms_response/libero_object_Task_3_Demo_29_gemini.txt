## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered environment and placing it into a basket.  The environment consisted of a surface (floor or table) with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The BBQ sauce was initially located somewhere on the surface, and the basket was also present on the surface.  The goal was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle and place it inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Locate and Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to identify the location of the BBQ sauce and move its arm to a position above it. This involved navigating the cluttered environment and positioning for grasping.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 4-5) The robot needed to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-10) The robot had to lift the BBQ sauce bottle from its initial position and then transport it to the basket.

4. **Locate and Approach Basket:** (Steps 8-10) The robot moved its arm carrying the BBQ sauce towards the basket, potentially requiring adjustments for accurate positioning.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 11-16) The robot needed to carefully place the BBQ sauce bottle inside the basket, requiring the opening of the gripper and precise positioning.
