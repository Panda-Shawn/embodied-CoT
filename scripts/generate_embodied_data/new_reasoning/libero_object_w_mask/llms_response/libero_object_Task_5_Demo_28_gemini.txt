## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle is assumed to be located to the right and slightly lower than the robot's initial position. The basket is assumed to be located to the left and higher up than the initial position of the robot.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** This involves navigating to a position where the robot's gripper can reach the tomato sauce bottle. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:**  This involves positioning the gripper correctly and closing it around the bottle. (Steps 5-8)
3. **Lift the tomato sauce:** This involves lifting the bottle to a safe height, clearing the surface. (Steps 9-11)
4. **Navigate to the basket:** This involves moving the bottle to a position above the basket. (Steps 12-16)
5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This involves lowering the bottle into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 17-19)
6. **Return to a resting state:** The robot stops. (Step 20)
