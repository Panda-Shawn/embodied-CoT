## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained the butter, a basket (on the floor), a bottle of ketchup (next to the basket), bottles of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding, all situated on the floor. The robot needed to navigate this cluttered space, precisely grasp the butter without disturbing other items, and then transport it to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to maneuver to a position where it could reach the butter without colliding with other objects.

2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 4-9) The robot had to lower its arm, precisely position its gripper over the butter, and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and move the butter to the basket:** (Steps 10-12) The robot raised the butter, moved it to the vicinity of the basket.

4. **Position and release the butter:** (Steps 13-17)  The robot lowered the butter into the basket, opened its gripper to release it, and then retracted its arm.
