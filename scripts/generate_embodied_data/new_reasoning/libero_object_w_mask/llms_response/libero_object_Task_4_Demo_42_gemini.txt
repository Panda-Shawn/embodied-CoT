## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was initially located to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly lower than the ketchup bottle's position. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, move it across to the basket, and then carefully place it inside the basket without spilling.  The robot's gripper needed to open and close appropriately to achieve the pickup and placement.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4.  This involved moving the robot arm to a position directly above the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping.  This was necessary to position the robot arm correctly for the gripping action.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-5. The robot closed its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.  This was necessary to successfully lift the bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. The robot lifted the ketchup bottle to avoid colliding with the surface. This was needed to free the ketchup bottle from the surface.

4. **Move Ketchup to Basket:** Steps 7-10. The robot arm moved the ketchup bottle to the basket. This step involved navigating the bottle to the basket, ensuring minimal movement to maintain stability.

5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 10-15. The robot maneuvered the ketchup into the basket and released its grip. This was crucial for successful task completion.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 16-17. The robot moved away from the basket to a safe position. This was necessary to avoid collisions.
