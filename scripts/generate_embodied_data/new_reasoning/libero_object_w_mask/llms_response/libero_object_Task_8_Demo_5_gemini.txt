## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket. The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, and a basket positioned on the floor. The objects were not interacting with each other.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-3) This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the chocolate pudding to grasp it.  The robot needed to navigate the cluttered floor to reach the pudding without colliding with other objects.

2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-7)  This involved precise maneuvering to position the gripper around the pudding bottle and then closing the gripper to securely hold it.

3. **Lift the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 8-9) This elevated the pudding bottle above the floor, clearing it from obstacles.

4. **Move to the Basket:** (Steps 10-12) The robot needed to reposition itself to be above the basket, preparing to deposit the pudding.

5. **Place the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** (Steps 13-17) This involved lowering the pudding into the basket and then releasing it by opening the gripper.
