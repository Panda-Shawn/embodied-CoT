## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface, requiring the robot arm to reach, grasp, and lift it. The basket was located at a different position than the ketchup, necessitating movement of the arm to a new location to deposit the ketchup.  The overall environment was assumed to be a simple tabletop scene where the locations of the ketchup and basket are known to the robot.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 1-5.  This movement involved positioning the robot arm in proximity to the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping. This is necessary to bring the robot's gripper within range of the ketchup.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 5-7. This movement involved grasping the ketchup bottle securely using the gripper.  This is necessary to pick up the bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 7-8.  This movement raised the ketchup bottle, clearing it from the surface. This is necessary to safely transport the ketchup.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-10. This movement involved navigating the robot arm to the basket location. This is necessary to place the ketchup in the designated area.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 10-13. This movement involved positioning the ketchup bottle over the basket and releasing it. This is necessary to complete the task.
