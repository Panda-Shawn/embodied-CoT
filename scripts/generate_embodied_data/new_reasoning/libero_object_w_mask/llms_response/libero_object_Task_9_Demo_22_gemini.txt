## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The robot's task was to pick up the bottle of orange juice and place it in the basket. The basket is located on the floor, and the orange juice bottle is situated next to it.  Other objects—ketchup, BBQ sauce, salad dressing, and butter—are also present in the scene, some on the floor and some on a table.  The basket initially contains butter and chocolate pudding. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation, and the intended outcome is the successful transfer of the orange juice from its initial location to inside the basket.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-6)  The robot needs to navigate to the orange juice bottle to grasp it. This involves moving towards the general area where the bottle is located.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 6-8)  Once close enough, the robot must accurately position its gripper over the bottle and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** (Steps 8-11) The grasped orange juice needs to be lifted clear of the surface to avoid collisions.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 11-24) This involves moving the robot arm, holding the orange juice bottle, to the basket’s location while avoiding obstacles.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 24-30) The orange juice is positioned and placed inside the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 30-33) The robot arm needs to move away from the basket to finish the task.
