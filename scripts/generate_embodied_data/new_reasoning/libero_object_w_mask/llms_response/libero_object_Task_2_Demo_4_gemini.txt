## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a table and placing it in a nearby basket.  The environment included a table with several other items (ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce) scattered around. The salad dressing was initially on the table, and the basket was also on the table, but not directly next to the salad dressing. The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the salad dressing bottle.
2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** This involved precisely positioning the robotic arm and closing the gripper to grasp the bottle.
3. **Move to the basket:** The robot then had to transport the salad dressing to the basket.
4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:**  The robot needed to accurately position the bottle within the basket and release it.


**High-Level Movement Breakdown:**

| High-Level Movement         | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach salad dressing      | 0-4        | The robot needed to get close enough to the salad dressing to manipulate it.       |
| Pick up salad dressing      | 5-7        | This involved precisely positioning the arm and closing the gripper to secure the bottle. |
| Move to basket              | 12-18       | Transport the salad dressing to the basket, navigating around other objects.   |
| Place salad dressing in basket | 19-34       | This included precise positioning and releasing the bottle into the basket.       |
