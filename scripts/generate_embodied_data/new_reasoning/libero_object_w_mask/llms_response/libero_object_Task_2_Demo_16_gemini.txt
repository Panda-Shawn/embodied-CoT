## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it into a nearby wicker basket. The environment contained several food items: salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk, all positioned relatively close to each other and a white wicker basket on a wooden floor.  Tomato sauce was also present on the table. The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing bottle. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the salad dressing from its initial location to the inside of the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can effectively grasp the salad dressing bottle. This involves moving forward and adjusting its position to account for obstacles.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-6) The robot needs to lower its gripper and securely grasp the bottle of salad dressing.

3. **Lift and move the salad dressing to the basket:** (Steps 7-10) The robot needs to lift the salad dressing and transport it to the basket's location.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot needs to carefully position the salad dressing inside the basket and release its grip.

5. **Return to a neutral position:** (Steps 15) The robot finishes the task and returns to a safe position.
