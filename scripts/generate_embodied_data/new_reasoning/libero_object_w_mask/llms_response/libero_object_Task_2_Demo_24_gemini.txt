## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered tabletop and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained a variety of food items: salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce.  The salad dressing bottle was initially located somewhere on the table among these other items. The basket was also on the table. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robotic arm to achieve the goal of transferring the salad dressing bottle into the basket. The intended outcome was the successful relocation of the salad dressing into the designated basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the salad dressing bottle.  This involved moving towards the area where the objects were located on the table.

2. **Locate and Grasp the Salad Dressing:** (Steps 4-6) Once near the salad dressing, the robot had to precisely position itself above the bottle and grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport the Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-10) With the salad dressing securely grasped, the robot had to lift it and move it towards the basket. A slight rotation might have been necessary to orient the bottle for easier placement.

4. **Place the Salad Dressing in the Basket:** (Steps 11-14)  The robot needed to position the salad dressing above the basket and then carefully release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 15-16) After successfully placing the salad dressing, the robot retreated slightly.
