## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The tomato sauce was situated on a surface, likely a countertop or table, and the basket was positioned somewhat away from the sauce, possibly requiring the robot to move laterally. The sauce bottle's orientation likely needed adjustment before grasping, and the robot had to maneuver to avoid obstacles. The general sequence involved: approaching the sauce, grasping the sauce, lifting the sauce, moving to the basket, and placing the sauce in the basket.


The high-level movements are as follows:

1. **Approach and Position:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to maneuver itself to a position directly above the tomato sauce bottle, orienting itself appropriately for grasping. This involved moving forward, rotating to account for the bottleâ€™s position and orientation, and adjusting its height.

2. **Grasping the Sauce:** (Steps 7-9)  The robot needed to close its gripper around the tomato sauce bottle. This required positioning over the bottle.

3. **Lifting the Sauce:** (Steps 10-17) The robot lifted the tomato sauce bottle.  This involved a movement upward, possibly with minor adjustments for stability.

4. **Moving to Basket:** (Steps 17-20) The robot moved to place the sauce bottle in the basket. This could include lateral movements to reach the basket.

5. **Placing the Sauce:** (Steps 20-23) The robot needed to place the bottle into the basket, opening its gripper to release the bottle.

6. **Final Adjustments** (Steps 24-25) The robot made any final posture adjustments for stability after completing the task.
