## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other objects present on the table included orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The spatial relationships between these objects are not explicitly defined, but the robot's trajectory implies it had to navigate around them. The primary activity was the manipulation of the chocolate pudding, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial location to inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4)  This phase involved maneuvering the robotic arm into a position above the chocolate pudding, preparing for grasping. This was necessary to get the robot's gripper in the right location to pick up the pudding.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 5-6)  This involved actuating the gripper to securely hold the pudding. This was necessary to successfully pick up the pudding.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 7-10) This involved lifting the pudding clear of the table to avoid collisions during transport.  This was necessary to move the pudding without knocking over other objects.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-14) This involved moving the arm holding the pudding towards the basket. This was necessary to transport the pudding to its destination.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 15-16)  This involved releasing the pudding into the basket. This was the final step to complete the task objective.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 17) The robot moved away from the basket to ensure no further interference with the successfully placed pudding.
