## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a container of cream cheese from a basket and placing it back in the basket.  The environment consisted of a table or floor with several objects: a basket (containing the cream cheese initially), cream cheese, alphabet soup, milk, tomato sauce, butter, and orange juice. The objects were scattered around the table. The primary activity was manipulation of the cream cheese, the intended outcome being that the cream cheese remains in the basket after being temporarily moved.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Basket:** Steps 0-5. The robot needs to navigate to the basket to reach the cream cheese.
2. **Pick up the Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-10.  The robot needs to grasp the cream cheese.
3. **Move to a Safe Placement Point:** Steps 11-14.  The robot needs to move away slightly from the basket before placing the cream cheese to avoid collisions.
4. **Place the Cream Cheese back in the Basket:** Steps 15-18.  The robot needs to place the cream cheese in the basket.
5. **Final Stop:** Step 19. The task is complete.
