### Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a cream cheese container from a surface and place it into a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is positioned at a different location also within reach. The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, then navigate to the basket and deposit the cream cheese.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed is:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** The robot moves to a position above the cream cheese, preparing to grasp it.  (Steps 1-6)
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** The robot closes its gripper around the cream cheese. (Steps 7-8)
3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** The robot lifts the cream cheese from the surface. (Steps 9-11)
4. **Navigate to Basket:** The robot moves to a position above the basket, preparing to release the cream cheese. (Steps 12-15)
5. **Release Cream Cheese:** The robot releases the cream cheese into the basket. (Steps 16-20)
