## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  Other objects were present in the environment: tomato sauce, orange juice, chocolate pudding, and bbq sauce on a table; and ketchup on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task. The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the butter, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, and releasing it into the basket.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-4. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the butter to grasp it.  The robot needed to navigate to the butter's location, avoiding obstacles.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 4-5. This involved closing the gripper around the butter to secure it.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 6-9.  This movement raised the butter off the floor, clearing it from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-13. This involved moving the butter from its initial location to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** Steps 14-17. This consisted of releasing the butter into the basket.
