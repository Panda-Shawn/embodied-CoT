## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at a different location, requiring movement and potentially orientation adjustments. The robot's high-level movements suggest a strategy of navigating to the sauce, grasping it, and then moving to the basket's location for placement.


The high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges are as follows:

1. **Approach the Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robotic arm closer to the location of the tomato sauce.  It was necessary to position the arm optimally for grasping.

2. **Grasp the Tomato Sauce:** Steps 5-8. This phase focused on accurately positioning the gripper above the sauce and closing the gripper to securely hold it.

3. **Lift and Move to the Basket:** Steps 14-17. After securing the sauce, the arm lifts the sauce and moves it towards the basket's location.

4. **Position above Basket:** Steps 18-19. This involves positioning the arm precisely over the basket, preparing for placement.

5. **Place the Tomato Sauce in the Basket:** Steps 19-21. This is the final phase, where the sauce is released into the basket.

6. **Stop:** Steps 9, 11, 13, 22.  These are stopping points within the overall task that allow for fine adjustment and ensure a smooth transition between different parts of the task.
