1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from an unspecified location and placing it into a basket.  The objects involved were a tomato sauce bottle and a basket.  Their initial relative positions aren't explicitly stated, but the trajectory suggests the sauce bottle was somewhat in front of and potentially lower than the robot's starting position, while the basket was likely to the robot's left.

The high-level movements that constitute the robot's plan were likely as follows:


| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the tomato sauce    | 1-7        | To get into a position to grasp the sauce bottle.                             |
| Grasp the tomato sauce       | 7-8        | To secure the sauce bottle for transport.                                      |
| Lift the tomato sauce        | 9-11       | To clear the sauce bottle from its original position.                           |
| Move to the basket           | 11-13      | To transport the sauce bottle to its destination.                              |
| Position above the basket   | 13-14      | To accurately position the bottle for placing in the basket.                    |
| Place the tomato sauce       | 15-16      | To release the sauce bottle into the basket.                                   |
| Retract from the basket      | 17-19      | To move away from the basket, completing the task.                             |
