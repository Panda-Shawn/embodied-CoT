## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and further below the robot's initial position.  The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve this goal was:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:**  The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position to grasp the milk carton.  This involved moving right and then down to approach the carton. This spans steps 0-2.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** The robot needed to pick up the milk carton using its gripper. This requires moving to the milk carton and closing the gripper. This spans steps 3-5.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:**  The robot needed to lift the milk carton after grasping it. This involves a vertical upward movement. This spans steps 6-8.

4. **Move to Basket:** The robot needed to move the grasped milk carton towards the basket. This involved moving left, and potentially adjusting vertically or horizontally. This spans steps 8-10.

5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** The robot needed to lower the milk carton into the basket and release its grip. This involves moving down and opening the gripper. This spans steps 10-13.

6. **Return to Rest Position:** The robot may or may not complete this step. Based on the trajectory, it appears it stops. This spans step 14.
