## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly below the robot's starting position.  The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-6. The robot needed to move to a position above the milk carton to grasp it. This involved a series of movements to the right and down.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 5-6. The robot needed to close its gripper to secure the milk carton.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 7-9.  The robot lifted the milk carton vertically to clear the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-13. The robot moved the milk carton to a position above the basket. This involved a series of movements to the left and down.

5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 13-17. The robot needed to place the milk carton in the basket and release it. This involved lowering the milk carton into the basket and opening the gripper.
