## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and slightly down from the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and further back from the initial position of the milk carton.  The robot had to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Milk:** Steps 1-8. The robot moves towards the milk carton, positioning itself to grasp it.  This is necessary to gain access to the milk carton before it can be manipulated.

2. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 9-10. After securing the milk carton, the robot lifts it from the surface. This is essential to move the milk carton without obstructing the surface.

3. **Transport to Basket:** Steps 11-16. The robot moves to the basketâ€™s location. This is essential to deliver the milk carton to its desired location.

4. **Position over Basket:** Steps 17-19.  The robot positions itself above the basket for accurate placement. The accuracy is critical to avoid dropping the carton.

5. **Release Milk Carton:** Steps 20-24. The robot releases the milk carton into the basket.  This is the final action to complete the task.
