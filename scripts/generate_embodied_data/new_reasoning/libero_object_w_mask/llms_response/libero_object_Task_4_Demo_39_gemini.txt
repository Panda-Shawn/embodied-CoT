## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle and basket are assumed to be within reach of the robotic arm.  The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup bottle, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.  The high-level movements involved are:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-3. The robot needs to move to a position above the ketchup bottle to be able to grasp it. This involves positioning itself appropriately for gripping.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Step 3. The robot needs to close its gripper to securely hold the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. The robot lifts the ketchup bottle, ensuring a secure grip, to move it clear of the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-9.  The robot moves the ketchup bottle to a position above the basket, ready for placement.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 9-12. The robot lowers the ketchup into the basket and releases its grip.

6. **Retract Arm:** Steps 12-14. The robot moves its arm away from the basket to a safe position, completing the task.
