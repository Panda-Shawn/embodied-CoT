## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was positioned on a surface, presumably a table or counter, requiring the robot to navigate to its location. The basket was located at a separate, albeit unspecified location. The robot needed to execute a sequence of movements to approach the sauce bottle, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and deposit it.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Sauce Bottle:** Steps 0-4. This involved moving the robotic arm towards the general location of the tomato sauce bottle, adjusting its orientation to be ready for grasping. This stage is necessary to bring the robot's end effector within reach of the target object.

2. **Grasp Sauce Bottle:** Steps 5-8. This included the precise movements to position the gripper above the sauce bottle and then closing the gripper to secure it. This is essential to pick up the object.

3. **Lift Sauce Bottle:** Steps 9-11. This involved lifting the sauce bottle off the surface. This is required to clear the object from the surface and allows for transportation.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 11-13. This involved moving the arm carrying the sauce bottle towards the basket's location.  This brings the object to its target location.

5. **Place Sauce Bottle in Basket:** Steps 13-17. This involved moving the arm over the basket, opening the gripper to release the sauce bottle, and withdrawing the arm. This final stage completes the task.
