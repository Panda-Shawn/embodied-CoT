## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly lower than the milk carton. The primary activity was a two-phase manipulation: pick and place. The intended outcome was to have the milk carton safely inside the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Milk:** Steps 0-4.  This movement was necessary to position the robot's gripper correctly above the milk carton and then grasp it.

2. **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 5-7. This movement was crucial for lifting the grasped milk carton clear of the surface and moving it towards the basket.

3. **Position above Basket:** Steps 8-12. This movement brought the milk carton to a position directly above the basket, preparing for placement.

4. **Place and Release Milk:** Steps 13-15. This movement involved carefully lowering the milk carton into the basket and releasing it.

5. **Final Adjustment:** Steps 16-17.  This final movement ensured the milk carton was properly placed and stable within the basket.
