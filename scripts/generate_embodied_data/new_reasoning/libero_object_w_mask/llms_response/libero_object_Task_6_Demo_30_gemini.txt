## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from the floor to the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-2)  The robot needed to position itself above the butter to be able to pick it up.  This involved moving towards the butter's location.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 3-4) The robot had to close its gripper around the butter to secure it for transport.

3. **Lift and Transport Butter:** (Steps 5-7) The robot lifted the butter and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 8-10)  The robot maneuvered itself above the basket to place the butter inside.

5. **Release Butter:** (Steps 11-12) The robot opened its gripper to release the butter into the basket.
