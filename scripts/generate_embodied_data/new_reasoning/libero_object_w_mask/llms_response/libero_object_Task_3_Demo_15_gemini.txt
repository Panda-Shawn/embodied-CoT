## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it in a basket. The environment contained various food items such as BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, scattered on a wooden surface.  The BBQ sauce was initially located near other items, not yet in the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket, placing it inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to position itself close enough to the BBQ sauce to grasp it. This involved moving forward and adjusting its position to approach the sauce accurately.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 4-6) Once close enough, the robot had to lower its gripper to pick up the BBQ sauce.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-10) After grasping the sauce, the robot had to lift it carefully and then move it toward the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 11-14) This required maneuvering the bottle over the basket and opening the gripper to release the sauce inside.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 15-16)  The robot moved away to avoid obstacles after successfully placing the sauce into the basket.
