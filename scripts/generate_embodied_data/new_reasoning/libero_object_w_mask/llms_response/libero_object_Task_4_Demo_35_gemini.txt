## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it in a basket located on the same surface.  The environment contains several other condiment bottles (bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk) on the same wooden surface/table as the ketchup and the basket.  The robot must navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-3. The robot needs to position itself correctly above the ketchup bottle to grasp it. This involves moving right and then down to approach the ketchup bottle.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. The robot closes its gripper to pick up the ketchup bottle. This requires the robot to be positioned correctly above the ketchup.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. The robot lifts the ketchup bottle to a safe height to avoid obstacles during transport to the basket.

4. **Transport Ketchup:** Steps 7-10. The robot moves the ketchup bottle towards the basket.  This involves a movement left and up to clear space, followed by movement left and down to approach the basket.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 10-11. The robot carefully positions itself above the basket to release the ketchup.

6. **Release Ketchup:** Steps 11-14. The robot opens its gripper to release the ketchup bottle into the basket and moves upward to clear the basket.

7. **Retreat:** Steps 14-15. The robot moves to a safe position after completing the task.
