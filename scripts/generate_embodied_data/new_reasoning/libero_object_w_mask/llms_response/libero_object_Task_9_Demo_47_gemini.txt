## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it into a basket.  The orange juice is assumed to be on a surface, and the basket is located elsewhere in the robot's workspace. The robot needs to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and finally, release the orange juice into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements is:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** The robot moves to a position above the orange juice bottle. (Steps 1-4)
2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** The robot lowers its gripper, closes the gripper around the orange juice bottle, and lifts it. (Steps 5-8)
3. **Move to Basket:** The robot moves the orange juice to a position above the basket. (Steps 9-12)
4. **Release Orange Juice:** The robot lowers the orange juice into the basket and opens its gripper to release it. (Steps 13-16)
