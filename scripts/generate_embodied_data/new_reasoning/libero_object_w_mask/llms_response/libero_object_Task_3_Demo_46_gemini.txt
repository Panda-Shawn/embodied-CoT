## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a countertop and placing it in a basket on the floor. The environment contained several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, chocolate pudding, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) arranged linearly on a surface, with a basket situated on the floor nearby.  The BBQ sauce was located next to the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket, carefully placing it inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-4)  The robot needs to move into position to reach the BBQ sauce. This involves moving forward and adjusting its position to be directly in front of the sauce.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8) The robot lowers its arm, closes its gripper to grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 9-12) The robot lifts the bottle and moves it towards the basket. This involves moving upward and slightly left to clear any obstacles and navigate to the basket's location.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot positions the BBQ sauce above the basket, opens its gripper to release the bottle, and then adjusts its position.

5. **Return to Rest Position:** (Steps 17-19) The robot returns to a neutral position after successfully placing the BBQ sauce.
