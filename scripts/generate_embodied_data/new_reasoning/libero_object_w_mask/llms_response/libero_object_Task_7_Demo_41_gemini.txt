## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was positioned to the right and slightly down from the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and somewhat lower than the milk's position. The primary activity was manipulating the robot arm to grasp the milk carton securely and then transport it to the basket without dropping it. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the milk carton from its initial position to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-6. This involved moving the robot arm into a position to grasp the milk carton.  This was necessary to bring the robotic gripper close enough to interact with the milk.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 6-7. This involved closing the gripper around the milk carton to secure a grip. This is essential for successful object transportation.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 7-8. This involved lifting the milk carton to a safe height above the surface to prevent it from hitting the surface during transport. It was necessary to clear obstacles and allow for unobstructed movement.

4. **Transport to Basket:** Steps 8-11. This involved moving the milk carton to a position above the basket. This was essential for placing the milk carton within the basket accurately and without dropping it.

5. **Lower Milk Carton:** Steps 11-13. This involved lowering the milk carton into the basket. This step was crucial for depositing the milk carton into the designated location.

6. **Release Milk Carton:** Steps 12-13. This involved opening the gripper to release the milk carton into the basket. This is the final action for task completion.

7. **Retract and Stop:** Steps 14-16. This involved moving the arm to a safe position away from the basket and stopping. This ensures the task is fully completed and the robot is in a safe state.
