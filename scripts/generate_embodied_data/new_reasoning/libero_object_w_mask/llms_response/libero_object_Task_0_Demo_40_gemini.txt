### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located separately. The primary activity was a transfer operation, with the intended outcome being the alphabet soup safely deposited in the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-2)  This initial movement was necessary to position the robot arm close enough to grasp the soup container.

2. **Grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 3-6) This involved moving the arm down and closing the gripper to securely hold the container.

3. **Lift the alphabet soup:** (Steps 7-8) This movement raised the soup container, clearing it from the table.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 9-11) This involved moving the arm to the location of the basket.

5. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** (Steps 12-14) This involved carefully lowering the container into the basket and releasing it.
