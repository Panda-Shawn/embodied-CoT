## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving the salad dressing from the floor and placing it into a basket, also located on the floor. The robot operated in an environment containing several food items: a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup near the basket, milk and cream cheese on a table, and alphabet soup and tomato sauce on the floor.  The arrangement suggests a meal preparation scenario.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the salad dressing before attempting to grasp it. This involved maneuvering around other obstacles on the floor.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 4-5)  Once positioned correctly, the robot had to lower its gripper to pick up the salad dressing.

3. **Lift and Transport Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-8) This stage involved lifting the salad dressing and moving it towards the basket.

4. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot had to carefully maneuver the salad dressing above the basket, accounting for the possibility of the salad dressing's position relative to the basket.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 13-16)  The robot needed to lower the salad dressing into the basket and release its grip.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-19) Finally, the robot moved away from the basket to complete the task.
