## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it in a white wicker basket, also situated on the floor.  The butter and basket were positioned next to each other. Other objects were present in the environment, but their locations (on the floor or table) were irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from the floor to the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach Butter:** The robot needed to move its arm into a position where it could grasp the butter.  This involves positioning the gripper near the butter. This corresponds to steps 0-2.

2. **Grasp Butter:** The robot had to close its gripper around the butter to secure a hold. This is step 3.

3. **Lift Butter:**  The robot needed to lift the butter from the floor. This corresponds to steps 7-8.

4. **Move to Basket:** The robot had to move the butter from its current position to a location above the basket. This is done in step 8-9.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** The robot needed to open its gripper to release the butter into the basket. This corresponds to steps 10-12.

6. **Retreat:** The robot should move away after placing the butter to avoid interfering with the basket. This is step 16-18.
