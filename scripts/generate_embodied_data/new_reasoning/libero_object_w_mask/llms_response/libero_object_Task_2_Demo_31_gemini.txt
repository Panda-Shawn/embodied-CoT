## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from within a basket and placing it back into the same basket.  The environment included a table or floor with a basket containing the salad dressing. Other items – ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce – were scattered around. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the salad dressing remaining in the basket (it was already there, implying a test of the robot's ability to perform the task without disturbing the existing arrangement).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the basket:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the basket where it could reach the salad dressing. (Steps 0-2)

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** This entailed moving the arm down to grasp the salad dressing with the gripper. (Steps 3-4)

3. **Lift the salad dressing:** After grasping the salad dressing, the arm moved upwards to lift the bottle out of the basket. (Steps 6-7)


4. **Place the salad dressing back in the basket:**  This involved moving the arm to position the salad dressing above the basket, then carefully lowering it into the basket. (Steps 8-14)

5. **Retract the arm:** This is implicit in the task instructions. Steps 14-15 represent a final action of moving the arm upwards.
