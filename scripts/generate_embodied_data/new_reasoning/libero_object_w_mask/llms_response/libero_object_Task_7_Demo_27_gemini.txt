## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the robot's right and slightly below its reach. The basket was located further away from the robot, to the left and forward. The robot needed to navigate to the milk, grasp it, lift it, and then carefully transport it to the basket's location, releasing the milk into the basket.

Based on the trajectory, the robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk:** Steps 0-4. The robot moved to a position above the milk carton, positioning itself for grasping. This involved moving right and downwards, aligning its gripper with the carton's location.

2. **Grasp Milk:** Steps 5-8. The robot lowered its gripper, closed it around the milk carton, and secured its grasp.  This included careful backward and downward movements to prevent accidental knocks or slips.

3. **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 9-13. The robot lifted the milk carton, moving it upwards and slightly forwards, initiating the transport phase towards the basket.

4. **Position above Basket:** Steps 14-16. The robot navigated to a position above the basket, positioning the milk carton for placement.

5. **Release Milk:** Steps 17-19. The robot lowered the milk into the basket, opened its gripper, and completed the task.
