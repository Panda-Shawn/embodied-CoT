## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it into a basket located on the floor. The environment contained several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, chocolate pudding, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) arranged near the basket, which was situated on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and carefully place it inside.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to approach the BBQ sauce bottle to be within reach of its gripper.
2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 4-8) The robot needed to lower itself, grasp the BBQ sauce bottle securely using its gripper.
3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce to Basket:** (Steps 9-13)  The robot lifted the BBQ sauce and moved it towards the basket.
4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) The robot had to carefully position the bottle above the basket and release it.
5. **Retreat:** (Steps 18-19) The robot moved away to a safe distance.
