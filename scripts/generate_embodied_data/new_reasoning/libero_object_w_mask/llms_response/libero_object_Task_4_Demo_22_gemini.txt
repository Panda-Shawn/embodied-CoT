## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle is assumed to be located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket is located to the left of the starting position. The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4.  This involves moving the robot arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping. This is necessary because the robot needs to be positioned correctly to pick up the ketchup.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. This phase focuses on closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle, securing it for lifting. This is a crucial step to ensure the successful pick-up.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 6-9.  The robot lifts the ketchup and moves it towards the basket.  This involves navigating the arm to avoid obstacles and repositioning it for placing the ketchup. This movement is needed to transport the ketchup to the target location.

4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 9-13. This involves lowering the ketchup into the basket and opening the gripper to release it. This is necessary to complete the main objective of placing the ketchup in the basket.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 14-15. The robot moves away from the basket after completing the task. This is a safety measure.
