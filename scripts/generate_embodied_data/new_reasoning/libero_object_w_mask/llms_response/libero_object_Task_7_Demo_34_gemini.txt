## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was positioned to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly lower than the milk carton's position.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-6.  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above and slightly to the right of the milk carton, then lowering itself to grasp the carton.  This was necessary to position the arm for grasping.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 7-9. This involved closing the gripper to secure the milk carton.  This was critical for successful object manipulation.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 10-11. This involved lifting the milk carton to a safe height, clearing it from the surface. This prevents accidental contact with the surface while moving.

4. **Move Milk Carton to Basket:** Steps 11-13. This involved moving the milk carton horizontally towards the basket. This was necessary to transport the milk to the destination.

5. **Lower Milk Carton into Basket:** Steps 13-15.  This involved lowering the milk carton above the basket and positioning it for release.  This was crucial for placing the milk carton precisely inside the basket.

6. **Release Milk Carton:** Steps 15-16. This involved opening the gripper to release the milk carton into the basket.  This completes the core objective of placing the milk into the basket.

7. **Return to Home Position:** Step 17. This involved moving to a neutral or home position, signifying task completion. This is standard procedure after a robotic arm completes a task.
