## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of milk and place it in a basket.  The milk carton is situated on a surface, and the basket is located to the side and slightly lower than the milk carton's position. The robot arm, equipped with a gripper, needs to navigate to the milk, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing the milk into the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-4. This involves positioning the robot arm close enough to the milk carton to grasp it.  This is necessary because the robot must be within reach of the milk before it can pick it up.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 4-6. This movement involves closing the gripper around the milk carton to secure a grip. This is necessary to ensure the milk carton is held firmly during the transfer.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 7-8. This movement raises the milk carton to clear any obstacles and begin the transfer. This is required to lift the milk carton high enough to transport it to the basket safely, without colliding with the surface.

4. **Transport Milk Carton to Basket:** Steps 8-11. This movement involves moving the milk carton horizontally and vertically to position it above the basket. This step is crucial to place the milk carton over the basket before release.

5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 11-14. This movement involves lowering the milk carton into the basket and releasing the gripper. This is the final step in completing the task successfully.
