## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a table or wooden floor and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained several other objects: orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup, all scattered around the chocolate pudding and basket. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to achieve a specific object transfer. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the chocolate pudding inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:**  (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to navigate to the chocolate pudding's location.  This involves maneuvering around other objects to reach a position suitable for grasping.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 6-9) Once in position, the robot must carefully grasp the pudding without knocking over surrounding items. Precise positioning and gripper closure are crucial here.

3. **Lift and Rotate Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 10-12) The robot lifts the pudding and may need to rotate it slightly to ensure a stable grip and prepare for transport.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 13-16)  The robot transports the pudding to the basket's location. This involves careful navigation to avoid obstacles.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 17-19) The robot releases the pudding into the basket, ensuring it is placed correctly.

6. **Finish:** (Step 20-21) The robot concludes its action.
