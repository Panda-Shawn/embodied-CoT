## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle is assumed to be located to the right and slightly down from the robot's starting position. The basket is assumed to be located further to the left, potentially at a similar height as the ketchup bottle's final placement. The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and release the ketchup into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needs to move into a position to grasp the ketchup bottle. This involves moving in the general direction of the ketchup.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 7-8) Close the gripper to pick up the ketchup bottle.
3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 9-10) Lift the ketchup bottle.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-13) Move towards the basket.
5. **Lower Ketchup:** (Steps 14-15) Lower the ketchup into the basket.
6. **Release Ketchup:** (Steps 14-15) Release the ketchup from the gripper.
7. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) Move away from the basket.
