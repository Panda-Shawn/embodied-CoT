## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the robot's right and slightly lower than its starting position. The basket was located to the robot's left and slightly lower than the milk's position. The primary activity was a manipulation task, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the milk carton from its initial position to the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the milk carton, grasping the milk carton, lifting the milk carton, moving the milk carton to the basket, placing the milk carton in the basket, and finally returning to a resting state.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Milk:** Steps 0-4. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the milk carton to grasp it securely.  The robot needed to navigate to the correct location before performing the grasp.

2. **Lift Milk:** Steps 5-7.  This movement was essential to lift the milk carton off the surface, clearing it for transport.

3. **Move Milk to Basket:** Steps 7-11.  This movement involved transporting the grasped milk carton across the workspace to the location of the basket.

4. **Place Milk in Basket:** Steps 11-14. This movement positioned the milk carton above the basket and then released it into the basket.

5. **Return to Rest:** Steps 14-15.  This final movement returned the robot arm to a neutral position after completing the task.
