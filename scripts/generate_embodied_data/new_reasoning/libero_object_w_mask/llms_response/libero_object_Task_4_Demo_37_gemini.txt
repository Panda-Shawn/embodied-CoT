## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface to the robot's right and slightly lower than its initial position. The basket was positioned to the robot's left and slightly lower than the ketchup's position.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the ketchup bottle. This involved moving to the right and then down.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 5-7)  The robot closes its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 8-9) The robot lifts the ketchup bottle.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-12) The robot moves to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Ketchup:** (Steps 13-15) The robot lowers the ketchup bottle into the basket and releases it.
