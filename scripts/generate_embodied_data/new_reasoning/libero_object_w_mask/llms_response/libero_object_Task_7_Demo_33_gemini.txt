1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was presumably located to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was likely located to the left of the milk carton.  The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.  The general sequence involved approaching the milk, grasping it, lifting it, moving to the basket, and releasing it.

High-Level Movements:

* **Approach and Grasp Milk:** Steps 1-7. This was necessary to get the robotic arm into a position to grasp the milk carton. The robot needed to move to the location of the milk, and position its gripper appropriately.
* **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 9-12. After grasping, the robot needed to lift the milk carton and move it towards the basket.
* **Place Milk in Basket:** Steps 13-18.  This involved moving the milk to the basket location and releasing it.
