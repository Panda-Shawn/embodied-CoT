## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other objects – orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup – were present on the table alongside the pudding and basket, but were not involved in the task.  The primary activity was manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the desired object placement. The intended outcome was to have the chocolate pudding inside the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-3) This involved maneuvering the robot arm to a position directly above the chocolate pudding, preparing for grasping.  This was necessary because the robot needed to position itself optimally for grasping the pudding without colliding with other objects.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-7) This involved closing the gripper around the pudding, securely holding it. This was a necessary intermediate step to enable lifting and moving the pudding.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-12) This involved lifting the pudding and moving it above the basket, setting it up for placement. This movement was crucial to transport the pudding to its target location.

4. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) This involved lowering the pudding into the basket and releasing it.  Opening the gripper was needed to deposit the pudding.
