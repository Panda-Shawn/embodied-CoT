## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contained a basket on the floor, a salad dressing bottle, a ketchup bottle, a carton of alphabet soup, a box of cream cheese, and a carton of milk.  The salad dressing and ketchup bottles were near the basket; the soup was next to the cream cheese; and the milk was next to the salad dressing. The primary activity was manipulation:  grasping and transporting the salad dressing bottle from its initial location to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the salad dressing bottle inside the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing bottle, positioning itself for grasping. This involved moving towards the general area of the bottle, adjusting its position to achieve the correct orientation and height to pick up the bottle.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-8)  The robot needed to grasp the salad dressing bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport Salad Dressing:** (Steps 9-12) The robot needed to lift the bottle and move it towards the basket, avoiding collisions with other objects.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot needed to carefully lower the bottle into the basket and release its grip.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) The robot needed to move away from the basket to avoid interference.
