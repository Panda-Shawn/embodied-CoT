## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a chocolate pudding from a basket and placing it back into the same basket.  This might seem redundant, but it allows us to test the robot's ability to perform precise movements and object manipulation. The basket is located on the floor.  Inside the basket are both the chocolate pudding and alphabet soup. Several other condiment bottles (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, and salad dressing) are positioned next to the basket on the floor.  The robot needs to navigate to the basket, precisely grasp the pudding without disturbing other items, and then return it to the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Basket:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to position itself appropriately to reach the pudding.
    * Justification: The robot must initially move into a position where it can reach the chocolate pudding without colliding with other objects.

2. **Pick up the Pudding:** (Steps 3-4) The robot must grasp the chocolate pudding.
    * Justification: This is the core action of the task; the robot cannot place the pudding without first picking it up.

3. **Lift the Pudding:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needs to lift the pudding to avoid obstacles during the relocation.
    * Justification: Raising the pudding clears the path and avoids accidental collisions during the movement to a new location.

4. **Return to Basket:** (Steps 7-10) The robot must navigate to the location above where the pudding should be placed.
    * Justification:  The robot must move the pudding to the designated basket area.

5. **Place the Pudding:** (Steps 11-12) The robot must release the pudding into the basket.
    * Justification: This is the final action to complete the task.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-15) The robot moves away from the basket.
    * Justification: This ensures the robot is clear of the area after completing the task.
