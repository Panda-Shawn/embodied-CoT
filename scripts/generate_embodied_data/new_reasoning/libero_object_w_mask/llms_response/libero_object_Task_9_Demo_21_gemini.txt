## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, presumably a table, and the basket was located some distance away, possibly on a different surface or location. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket, placing it carefully inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 1-4) The robot moved towards the orange juice to reach a position suitable for grasping.
2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-8) The robot positioned itself directly above the orange juice and closed its gripper to secure a grip.
3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** (Steps 10-13) The robot lifted the orange juice and moved it towards the basket.  The tilting movement suggests navigating potential obstacles or adjusting for the bottle's shape.
4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) The robot positioned the orange juice over the basket and then opened the gripper to release it.
5. **Depart:** (Steps 18-19) The robot opened the gripper and moved away from the basket.
