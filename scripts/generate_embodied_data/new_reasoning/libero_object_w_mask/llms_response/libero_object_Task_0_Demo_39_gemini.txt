## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained various items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, and other items (milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter) which are irrelevant to the task. The spatial relationships between these items are not explicitly described, but it is implied that the alphabet soup, basket, and other items are arranged in a way that allows the robot to maneuver around them.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needs to move to a position where its gripper can grasp the alphabet soup.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 5-7) The robot must close its gripper to secure the alphabet soup.

3. **Lift Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 8-10) The robot raises the alphabet soup to a clear height to prevent it from colliding with the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-14) The robot moves the soup to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 15-20) The robot lowers the soup into the basket and releases its grip.
