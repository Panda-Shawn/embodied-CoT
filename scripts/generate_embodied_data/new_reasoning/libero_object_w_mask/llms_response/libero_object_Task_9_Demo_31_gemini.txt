## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was positioned on a surface, likely a table or counter, within reach of the robotic arm. The basket was located at a separate location, requiring the robot to move the juice bottle from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Orange Juice (Steps 0-8):** This stage involved moving the robotic arm towards the orange juice bottle and securing a grip.  This is necessary to pick up the juice.

2. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice (Steps 9-11):**  After grasping the bottle, the robot needed to lift it and then move to the basket's location.

3. **Place Orange Juice in Basket (Steps 12-16):**  This final stage involves positioning the juice bottle above the basket and releasing it safely inside the basket.
