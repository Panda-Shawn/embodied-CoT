## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a location and placing it in a basket. The environment included a wooden surface with a BBQ sauce bottle, a basket, and several other condiment bottles (chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese).  The initial location of the BBQ sauce bottle is not explicitly stated, but based on the trajectory it is likely initially near the basket but not directly in it. The overall goal was to manipulate the robotic arm to pick up the BBQ sauce and place it within the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to navigate to a position above the BBQ sauce bottle, ready to grasp it. This involves maneuvering around obstacles to get to an optimal position for grasping.

2. **Grasp the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 5-8) The robot lowers its arm, engages its gripper, and securely grasps the BBQ sauce bottle.

3. **Lift and move the BBQ sauce to the basket:** (Steps 9-15) The robot lifts the BBQ sauce and moves to a location above the basket.  This likely involves avoiding collisions with other objects.

4. **Place the BBQ sauce in the basket:** (Steps 16-18)  The robot carefully lowers the BBQ sauce into the basket and releases its grip.
