## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter.  The precise spatial relationships aren't fully specified but it's implied that the robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach the soup and then the basket. The high-level movements necessary were:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** This involved navigating to the location of the alphabet soup, avoiding obstacles.  This likely spanned steps 1-7.
2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** This entailed positioning the robotic arm to grasp the soup container securely using the gripper. This corresponds to steps 5-7.
3. **Lift and Transport Alphabet Soup:** This involved lifting the grasped soup and moving it to the basket's location. Steps 8-10 were likely involved in this.
4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** This involved carefully placing the soup container inside the basket. Steps 11-15 handle this.
5. **Retract Arm:** This was the final step, releasing the grip and moving the arm away. This is step 15 and 16.
