## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce was located on a surface within the robot's reach, and the basket was positioned somewhat to the side and potentially at a slightly higher elevation. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket and deposit it gently.

Based on the trajectory, the robot's high-level movements are as follows:

1. **Approach and Position for Grasping (Steps 1-7):** The robot moved forward and adjusted its orientation to approach the tomato sauce bottle from an optimal grasping position. This involved maneuvering to achieve the correct alignment for gripping the bottle.

2. **Grasping the Tomato Sauce (Steps 8-11):**  The robot moved its gripper down and closed it around the bottle to secure a grasp.

3. **Lifting and Transporting to Basket (Steps 12-16):** The robot lifted the bottle and then moved it horizontally and slightly upward toward the basket.

4. **Placing the Tomato Sauce in the Basket (Steps 17-21):** The robot moved to align the bottle with the basket's interior, opened its gripper to release the bottle, and then adjusted its position to ensure the bottle was placed safely and stably within the basket.
