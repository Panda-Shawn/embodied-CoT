## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it into a basket.  We assume the cream cheese is on a table, and the basket is nearby, possibly also on the table.  The robot must navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The high-level movements likely followed are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3. The robot moves towards the cream cheese, positioning itself for grasping.  This is necessary to bring the robot arm within reach of the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. The robot lowers its gripper and closes it around the cream cheese. This is crucial to securely pick up the cream cheese.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 7-9. The robot lifts the cream cheese, ensuring a secure grip while moving. This prevents dropping the cream cheese during transport.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-11. The robot moves to the location of the basket, positioning itself to place the cream cheese inside. This step is necessary to place the cream cheese in the intended location.

5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 12-14. The robot lowers the cream cheese into the basket and opens its gripper to release it. This is the final step to complete the task.

6. **Return to Neutral Position:** Steps 15-17.  The robot moves to a resting position after completing the task. This is a standard practice for safety and to prepare for the next task.
