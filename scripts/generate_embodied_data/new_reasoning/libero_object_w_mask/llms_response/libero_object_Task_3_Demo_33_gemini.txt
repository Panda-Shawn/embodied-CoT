## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle and place it in the wicker basket. The environment contained several condiment bottles and a can of soup arranged near the basket, which was located on the floor.  The BBQ sauce was positioned next to the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, placing it inside and releasing its grip.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the BBQ sauce bottle.  This involved moving towards the general area of the basket and BBQ sauce.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-7)  The robot needed to grasp the bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 8-12) The robot had to lift the BBQ sauce bottle and move it toward the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot needed to position the BBQ sauce above the basket and carefully place it inside.

5. **Release BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 16-17) The robot needed to open its gripper to release the BBQ sauce into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 18-20) The robot would move away to a safe and stable position.
