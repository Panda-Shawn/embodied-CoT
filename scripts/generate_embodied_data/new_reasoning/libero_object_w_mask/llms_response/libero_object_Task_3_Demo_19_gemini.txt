## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, scattered on a wooden surface.  The initial location of the BBQ sauce is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory implies it was not already in the basket. The robot's goal was to manipulate the BBQ sauce bottle to transfer it to the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 1-6.  This phase involved navigating to the BBQ sauce's location and securing it with the gripper.  This was necessary to initiate the transfer of the BBQ sauce.

2. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** Steps 8-10.  This phase involved lifting the grasped BBQ sauce and moving it towards the basket's location.  This was needed to move the BBQ sauce from its original position to its destination.

3. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 11-14.  This phase involved positioning the BBQ sauce above the basket and releasing it into the basket.  This was the final step to complete the task.

4. **Retreat:** Steps 16-17.  This phase involved moving the robot arm away from the basket after successfully placing the BBQ sauce. This was a safety measure and finalization of the task.
