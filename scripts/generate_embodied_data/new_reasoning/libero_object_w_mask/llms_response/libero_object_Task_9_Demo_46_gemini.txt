## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it into a basket. The environment contained several bottles (orange juice, ketchup, BBQ sauce, salad dressing, butter) and a basket. The orange juice was located next to the basket, which was on the floor.  The other bottles were also near the basket. The primary activity was the manipulation of the orange juice bottle. The intended outcome was to successfully transfer the orange juice bottle from its initial position to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the orange juice:**  (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the orange juice bottle. This involved moving closer to the target object.

2. **Grasp the orange juice:** (Steps 4-5) The robot needed to reach the orange juice bottle and securely grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Lift the orange juice:** (Steps 6-8) The robot had to lift the orange juice bottle from the ground to a height sufficient for carrying it to the basket without obstructing the transfer.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 8-10)  The robot needed to move the orange juice bottle to the location of the basket. This might involve a sideways movement.

5. **Place the orange juice in the basket:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needed to accurately position the bottle above the basket and release it. This required lowering the bottle into the basket and releasing its grip.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14) The robot completes the task and stops.
