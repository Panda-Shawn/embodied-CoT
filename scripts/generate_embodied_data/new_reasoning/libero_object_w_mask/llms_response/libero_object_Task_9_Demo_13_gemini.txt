## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, and the basket was positioned at some distance from the juice.  The robot needed to navigate to the juice, grasp it, and then navigate to the basket to deposit it.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary involved:

1. **Approaching the Orange Juice:** The robot needed to move towards the orange juice bottle to reach a position where it could grasp it. This likely involved a combination of forward and lateral movements.

2. **Grasping the Orange Juice:** After reaching the orange juice, the robot needed to adjust its position and orientation to properly grip the bottle.  This required precise downward and rotational movements, along with closing the gripper.

3. **Moving to the Basket:** Once the orange juice was securely grasped, the robot needed to navigate to the location of the basket. This involved moving upwards, then laterally and downwards.

4. **Placing the Orange Juice in the Basket:** The robot needed to precisely position the orange juice bottle above the basket and release it. This required careful movement above the basket, followed by opening the gripper.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

| High-Level Movement       | Step Range | Justification                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Orange Juice | 0-5        | To get close enough to the orange juice to begin the grasping process.               |
| Grasping the Orange Juice  | 6-9        | To pick up the orange juice bottle securely.                                          |
| Moving to the Basket      | 10-15       | To transport the orange juice to the target location (basket).                    |
| Placing the Orange Juice  | 16-18       | To accurately place the orange juice into the basket and release it.              |
