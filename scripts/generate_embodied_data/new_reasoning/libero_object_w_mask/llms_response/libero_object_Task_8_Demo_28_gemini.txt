## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the chocolate pudding and place it in the basket. The environment contained several objects on a surface: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup.  The chocolate pudding and basket were positioned such that the robot needed to move to the pudding's location, grasp it, and then move to the basket's location to deposit it.  The other items were irrelevant to the task and their positions were not crucial to the robot's path planning.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to move to a position where its gripper could reach the chocolate pudding. This involved navigating around other objects on the table or floor.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-5)  The robot closed its gripper to secure the chocolate pudding.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifted the pudding and moved towards the basket's location.

4. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot positioned itself directly above the basket.

5. **Release Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 11-13)  The robot opened its gripper to release the pudding into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-15) The robot moved away from the basket to a safe distance.
