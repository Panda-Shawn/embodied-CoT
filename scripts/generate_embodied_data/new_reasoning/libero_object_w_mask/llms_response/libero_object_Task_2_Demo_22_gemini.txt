## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a table and placing it in a basket.  The environment included a table with several items: salad dressing, a basket, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing's initial location is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory suggests it was relatively close to the basket. The other objects were scattered around the table.  The primary activity was manipulation and the intended outcome was to successfully transfer the salad dressing bottle from its initial location into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the salad dressing.  This involved moving forward and potentially adjusting its position to accurately align with the target object.

2. **Pick Up Salad Dressing:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot lowered its arm, closed its gripper around the salad dressing bottle.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot moved the salad dressing to the basket, lifting and potentially maneuvering to avoid obstacles.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket and Retreat:** (Steps 13-16) The robot lowered the salad dressing into the basket, opened its gripper to release it, and then retracted its arm from the basket and stopped.
