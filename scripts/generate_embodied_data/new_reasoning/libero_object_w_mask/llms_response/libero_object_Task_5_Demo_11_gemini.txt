## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of tomato sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained various other items: milk and butter on a table, and orange juice and chocolate pudding cartons on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate to the tomato sauce, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approaching the Tomato Sauce:** This involved navigating the robot to a position where it could reach the tomato sauce.  This is likely steps 0-3.
2. **Grasping the Tomato Sauce:**  This involved precise maneuvering to position the gripper above the sauce and closing the gripper to secure the sauce. This is likely steps 4-8.
3. **Lifting and Transporting the Tomato Sauce:**  This phase focused on lifting the sauce, moving it over to the basket, and positioning it above the basket. This is likely steps 9-11 and 19-20.
4. **Placing the Tomato Sauce in the Basket:** This involved lowering the sauce into the basket and releasing it. This is likely steps 12-18.
5. **Returning to a neutral state:** This step consists of returning to a neutral state by stopping the movement. This is likely steps 20 and 21.
