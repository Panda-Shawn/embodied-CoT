## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and below the milk carton's position. The primary activity was manipulation of the milk carton, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the milk carton from its initial position to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the milk carton, grasping the milk carton, lifting the milk carton, moving the milk carton to the basket, and releasing the milk carton into the basket.


The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-3.  This movement was necessary to position the robot arm close enough to the milk carton to grasp it.  The robot needed to move to the location of the milk carton to interact with it.


2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 3-4. This movement involved closing the gripper to secure the milk carton. The robot needed to grip the milk carton to lift and transport it successfully.


3. **Lift and Move Milk Carton to Basket:** Steps 6-9. This movement involved lifting the milk carton and moving it toward the basket's location. After securing the milk carton, the next step is moving it to the target location (basket).


4. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 9-12.  This involved positioning the milk carton above the basket and releasing it. This step is necessary to complete the task objective, depositing the milk carton into the basket.


5. **Return to Rest:** Steps 12-13. This is a final movement to a neutral resting position, ending the task.
