## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  Both the cream cheese and the basket were present in the robot's workspace.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move to the basket, placing the cream cheese inside before terminating the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the cream cheese.  This involved navigating the workspace to get close enough to the target object.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 4-6)  Once close enough, the robot needed to lower its gripper, position itself directly above the cream cheese, and then close its gripper to secure the container.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 7-11) After successfully grasping the cream cheese, the robot had to lift the container and move it to the basket's location. This involved upward movement and lateral movement towards the basket.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** (Steps 12-14)  The robot needed to lower the cream cheese into the basket and release its grip.

5. **Terminate:** (Step 15) The robot stops after completing all subtasks.
