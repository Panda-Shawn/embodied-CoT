## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the transfer of the butter from its initial location to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the butter inside the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to position itself correctly above the butter to be able to grasp it. This involved moving to the general vicinity of the butter.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 3-4)  The robot needed to grasp the butter using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move Butter to Basket:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needed to lift the butter and transport it to the basket.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot needed to position itself above the basket and carefully place the butter inside.

5. **Finish:** (Steps 5,12) The robot needed to stop after completing the task.
