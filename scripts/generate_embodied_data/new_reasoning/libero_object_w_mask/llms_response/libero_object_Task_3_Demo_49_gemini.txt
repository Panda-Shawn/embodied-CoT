## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table or floor and placing it in a nearby basket.  The environment contained the BBQ sauce bottle next to a basket, along with several other condiment bottles (ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, chocolate pudding) and possibly other items also near the basket on a wooden surface. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce bottle, grasp it carefully, lift it, and transport it to the basket, then release it into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach the BBQ sauce:** The robot needed to move itself into a position where it could reach the BBQ sauce bottle. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Pick up the BBQ sauce:** This involved positioning the gripper, lowering it, grasping the bottle, and lifting it. (Steps 4-10)
3. **Move to the basket:** The robot then needed to move the bottle to the location of the basket. (Steps 12-17)
4. **Place the BBQ sauce in the basket:**  This involved carefully lowering the bottle into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 18-20)
5. **Return to a resting position:** The robot concludes the task by stopping. (Steps 21)
