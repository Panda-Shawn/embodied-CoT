## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup, a basket, milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter.  The exact spatial relationships between these items are not specified, but it's assumed the robot had visual input allowing it to locate the soup and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** This involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position directly above the alphabet soup. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** The robot then closed its gripper to pick up the soup. (Step 3)
3. **Lift Alphabet Soup:** The robot lifted the soup clear of the surface. (Steps 4-6)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot moved to a position above the basket. (Steps 7-11)
5. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:**  The robot opened its gripper to release the soup into the basket. (Steps 12-13)
6. **Retract:** The robot moved away from the basket. (Step 14)
