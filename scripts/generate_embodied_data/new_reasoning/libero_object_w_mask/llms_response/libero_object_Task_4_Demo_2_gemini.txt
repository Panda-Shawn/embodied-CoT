## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was presumably located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position, while the basket was located to the left and slightly below. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup bottle, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-4) Move to the location of the ketchup bottle and grasp it. This involved navigating to the correct position and then closing the gripper.
2. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 5-7) Lift the ketchup bottle from the surface. This required moving upward.
3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 7-9) Move the ketchup bottle towards the basket. This involved a movement to the left.
4. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 9-11) Position the ketchup bottle directly above the basket.  This might include lowering to a suitable height.
5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** (Steps 11-13) Carefully release the ketchup bottle into the basket. This involved opening the gripper.
6. **Final Adjustment (Optional):** (Steps 14-17) This optional step could be for repositioning the arm or tilting it to ensure stability of the bottle in the basket.
