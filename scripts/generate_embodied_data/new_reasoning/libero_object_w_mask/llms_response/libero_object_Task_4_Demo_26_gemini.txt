## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket. The ketchup bottle was initially positioned to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and below the ketchup.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and finally release the ketchup into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:**  Steps 1-7.  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping. This was necessary to position the gripper optimally for picking up the ketchup bottle.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 7-8.  This involved closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle to secure it. This action was crucial for successfully lifting and transporting the ketchup.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 9-10. This involved lifting the ketchup bottle slightly to ensure a secure grip and prepare for transport. The upward movement helps detach the ketchup from the surface.


4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-13. This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the basket. This step was necessary to position the ketchup bottle for placement.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 13-16. This involved moving the robotic arm down towards the basket and opening the gripper to release the ketchup. This action was crucial for successfully completing the main objective of the task.
