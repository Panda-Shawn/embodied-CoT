## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a stick of butter from the floor and placing it into a basket, also located on the floor.  Other items were present in the environment: tomato sauce, orange juice, chocolate pudding, and bbq sauce on a table; and ketchup on the floor. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task.  The primary activity was manipulation â€“ grasping and moving the butter. The intended outcome was the butter being inside the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:  approaching the butter, grasping the butter, lifting the butter, moving to the basket, placing the butter in the basket, and finally stopping.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-4. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the butter to grasp it.  The robot needed to navigate around any obstacles between its starting position and the butter.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 4-6. This involved precisely positioning the gripper over the butter and closing it to secure a firm grip.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 6-8.  This movement raised the butter from the floor, clearing any potential obstacles.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-11. This involved moving the butter to the location of the basket. The robot had to avoid obstacles while carrying the butter.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** Steps 11-15. This involved positioning the butter over the basket and opening the gripper to release it.

6. **Stop:** Steps 15-17. This concludes the task.
