## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a cream cheese container from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was positioned at a different location.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, and then transport it to the basket before releasing it.

The following high-level movements likely comprise the robot's plan:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese (Steps 1-5):** This phase involved moving the robotic arm to a position directly above the cream cheese container.  This is necessary to prepare for grasping.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese (Steps 5-7):** The robot moved its arm down to engage the gripper and grasp the cream cheese securely.

3. **Lift and Transport to Basket (Steps 8-12):** After grasping, the robot lifted the cream cheese and moved to the basket's location.  This involved lifting the arm upward, and then potentially moving it in lateral directions (left) to reach the basket's location.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket (Steps 12-15):**  The robot moved its arm downwards to place the cheese in the basket and subsequently released the grip to deposit it inside.
