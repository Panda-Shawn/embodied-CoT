## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it in a basket located on the same floor.  The environment included a basket, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and several other bottles (orange juice, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup). All objects were on the floor, not interacting with each other. The robot needed to navigate to the chocolate pudding, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket and release it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 1-6)  This involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above the chocolate pudding bottle.  This was necessary to allow the gripper to reach and grasp the pudding bottle.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-6) This stage focuses on closing the gripper around the pudding bottle, ensuring a secure hold. This was essential to successfully lift and transport the pudding.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 7-9) This step involves lifting the pudding bottle clear of the floor. It's necessary to avoid obstacles during transportation to the basket.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot moved to a position above the basket. This action is crucial for placing the pudding bottle accurately into the basket.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 12-14) This is where the robot carefully lowered the pudding bottle into the basket.

6. **Release Chocolate Pudding:** (Step 14) The gripper opened, releasing the pudding bottle into the basket.

7. **Return to Home Position:** (Steps 15-17) The robot returns to a safe and neutral position. While this isn't strictly part of placing the pudding in the basket, this final phase is a standard procedure in robotics, ensuring the system is ready for further commands.
