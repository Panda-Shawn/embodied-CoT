## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup and placing it into a basket.  The alphabet soup was initially located to the robot's right, while the basket was located to the robot's left.  The robot needed to navigate to the soup, grasp it, lift it, then navigate to the basket, and finally release the soup into the basket.  The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach Alphabet Soup | 1-6 |  The robot needs to move into position to grasp the alphabet soup. This involves moving right to approach the soup, then potentially adjusting its orientation for proper grip. |
| Grasp Alphabet Soup | 7-10 | The robot needs to secure its grip on the alphabet soup. This involves tilting the arm downwards towards the soup and closing the gripper. |
| Lift Alphabet Soup | 11-12 | The robot needs to lift the alphabet soup to a height that allows for safe transport to the basket without collision. |
| Transport Alphabet Soup | 13-17 | This involves moving the soup, holding it steadily, towards the basket. The movement includes moving to the left to approach the basket and considering the orientation.  |
| Place Alphabet Soup in Basket | 18-22 | This involves releasing the soup in the basket using controlled movement and gripper action. |
