## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it in a basket. The tomato sauce was positioned on a surface, likely a table or counter, while the basket was located some distance away and potentially at a different height. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket's location, and carefully place it inside.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-6. This movement involved navigating the robot arm to the location of the tomato sauce and closing the gripper to secure it.  This was necessary to begin the task of transferring the sauce to the basket.

2. **Lift Tomato Sauce:** Steps 7-8. Lifting the sauce was critical to clear it from the surface and allow for transportation.

3. **Transport Tomato Sauce to Basket:** Steps 9-17. This phase focused on moving the sauce from its original location to the proximity of the basket. It involved a combination of vertical and horizontal movements to navigate obstacles and ensure a smooth transition.

4. **Place Tomato Sauce in Basket:** Steps 18-23.  This final stage involved positioning the sauce over the basket, opening the gripper to release it, and safely retracting the arm. This was necessary to successfully complete the task.
