## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket. The environment contained a variety of objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, all situated on a wooden surface.  The initial state showed the BBQ sauce bottle located somewhere on the surface, while the basket was presumably in a relatively accessible position. The robot's goal was to successfully pick up the BBQ sauce and deposit it into the basket without disturbing other objects.


The robot likely followed a plan composed of the following high-level movements:

1. **Navigate to BBQ sauce:** This involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above the BBQ sauce bottle.  (Steps 1-5)  This was necessary to bring the end-effector within reach of the target object.

2. **Grasp BBQ sauce:**  The robot closed its gripper to secure the BBQ sauce bottle. (Steps 7)  This was crucial for picking up the bottle.

3. **Lift BBQ sauce:** The arm lifted the BBQ sauce bottle. (Steps 9-10) This was needed to clear the bottle from the surface.

4. **Navigate to basket:** The arm moved the BBQ sauce bottle to the basket. (Steps 11-13). This step was essential for placing the bottle in its destination.

5. **Place BBQ sauce in basket:** The robot opened its gripper, releasing the BBQ sauce into the basket (Steps 14-15). This completes the task's objective.
