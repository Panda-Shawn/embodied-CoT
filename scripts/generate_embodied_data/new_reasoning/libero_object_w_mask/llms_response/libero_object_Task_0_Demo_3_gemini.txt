## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of alphabet soup from a table and place it in a basket located on the same table or floor.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere. The robot needed to navigate to the alphabet soup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it.  The high-level movements likely followed are:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needs to position itself close enough to the alphabet soup to grasp it. This involves navigating around any potential obstacles on the table.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needs to close its gripper around the alphabet soup, securing a firm grip.

3. **Lift and Transport Alphabet Soup to Basket:** (Steps 8-14) The robot lifts the alphabet soup and moves it towards the basket, avoiding collisions with other objects on the table.

4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) The robot positions the alphabet soup inside the basket and then releases its grip.
