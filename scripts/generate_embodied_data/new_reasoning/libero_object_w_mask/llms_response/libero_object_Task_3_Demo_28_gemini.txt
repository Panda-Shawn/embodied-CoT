## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained a wooden surface (floor or table) with several objects: bbq sauce, basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The initial position of the BBQ sauce is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory implies it was not already in the basket. The goal was to move the BBQ sauce into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 0-5)  This involved navigating to the BBQ sauce's location and securely grasping it with its gripper.

2. **Lift and transport the BBQ sauce:** (Steps 6-8) This involved lifting the BBQ sauce and moving it towards the basket.

3. **Position and place the BBQ sauce in the basket:** (Steps 9-12) This involved carefully positioning the BBQ sauce above the basket and releasing it.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 13-16) This involved retracting the arm to a safe position.
