## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained various food items on a wooden surface: alphabet soup (the target object), a basket (the destination), milk, salad dressing, cream cheese, tomato sauce, and butter. The spatial relationships between these objects aren't explicitly defined, but we can infer that the robot needed to navigate around them to reach the soup and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** Steps 0-3.  This involved navigating to the location of the alphabet soup, maneuvering around any obstacles.
2. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** Steps 4-6.  This included positioning the gripper above the soup and then closing the gripper to grasp it.
3. **Lift and move the alphabet soup to the basket:** Steps 7-9. This involved lifting the soup and then moving it towards the basket.
4. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 10-13. This involved positioning the soup above the basket and opening the gripper to release it.
5. **Retreat:** Steps 14-15. This involved opening the gripper and stopping the robot at a safe location.
