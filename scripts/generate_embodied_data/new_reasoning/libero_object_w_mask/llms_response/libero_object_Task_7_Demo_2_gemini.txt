## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a carton of milk from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the robot's right and somewhat lower than its starting position. The basket was positioned to the robot's left and also slightly lower than the robot's starting position.  The overall sequence of events included: approaching the milk carton, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, placing it in the basket and finally stopping.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Milk:** Steps 0-5. The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton's location and secure a grip on it. This involved a series of movements to position the gripper correctly.

2. **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 6-10.  Once the milk carton was grasped, the robot had to lift it and move it towards the basket.  This required upward movement to clear the surface and a trajectory towards the target location.

3. **Place Milk in Basket:** Steps 11-15. The robot needed to accurately position the milk carton above the basket and then release it.  This involved adjustments to ensure proper placement and the opening of the gripper.

4. **Stop:** Step 16.  The robot terminates the task.
