### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a cluttered surface and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained several objects: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup, all situated on a wooden floor or table. The chocolate pudding was initially not in the basket, and the other objects were scattered around. The robot successfully manipulated the arm to grasp the pudding and deposit it in the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 1-6)  The robot needed to navigate to the pudding's location, avoiding obstacles. This involved positioning itself optimally for grasping.

2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 7-8)  The robot needed to close its gripper around the pudding to secure a firm hold.

3. **Lift the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 9-10) The robot lifted the pudding to a safe height for transportation.

4. **Move to the Basket:** (Steps 11-16) The robot moved the pudding to the basket, ensuring a clear path and stable carrying.  The tilt adjustments suggest the robot is adjusting its grip or orientation to prevent spilling.

5. **Place the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** (Steps 17-21) The robot carefully released the pudding into the basket, then moved clear to ensure the task's successful completion.
