## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was situated on a surface, requiring the robot arm to reach over and grasp it. The basket was located some distance from the juice, possibly at a different height and/or lateral position. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket without dropping it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 1-4)  The robot needed to initially move towards the orange juice to be within reach of its arm. This involved navigating to a position where the orange juice is accessible.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-7)  The robot needed to lower its arm and close its gripper to pick up the orange juice. This involved precise positioning to avoid collisions and secure gripping.

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** (Steps 9-12) The robot then needed to lift the grasped orange juice and move it toward the basket. This movement involved a vertical lift and a horizontal repositioning towards the basket's location.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 13-15)  The robot needed to lower the orange juice and release it into the basket. This requires careful positioning above the basket and opening the gripper.

5. **Stop:** (Steps 0, 8, 16) The stops at the beginning, middle and end of the trajectory are necessary to stabilize the robot's movements, prevent it from accidental movements and signal completion.
