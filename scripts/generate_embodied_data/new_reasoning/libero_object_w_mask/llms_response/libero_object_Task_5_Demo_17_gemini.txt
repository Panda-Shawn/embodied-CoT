## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of tomato sauce and place it in a basket. The environment contains a basket on the floor, milk and butter on a table (irrelevant to this task), orange juice and chocolate pudding on the floor (also irrelevant). The tomato sauce's location is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the trajectory.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the tomato sauce, picking it up, and moving it to the basket.


The high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps are as follows:

1. **Approach Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-4.  This movement is necessary to position the robot arm close enough to the tomato sauce to grasp it. The robot needs to navigate to the general vicinity of the sauce before attempting to pick it up.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 5-6.  This is crucial for successfully completing the task.  The gripper must close around the sauce to secure a stable hold.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-11. After grasping the sauce, the robot needs to lift it and move it towards the basket. This requires vertical movement (up) and horizontal movement (left).

4. **Place in Basket:** Steps 12-14.  This involves positioning the sauce above the basket and then releasing it.

5. **Depart:** Step 15. The robot concludes the task after successfully placing the tomato sauce in the basket.
