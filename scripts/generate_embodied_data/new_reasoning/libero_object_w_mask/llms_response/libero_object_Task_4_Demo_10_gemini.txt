## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was presumably located on a surface requiring the robot to navigate to its position. The basket was situated at a different location from the ketchup bottle.  The high-level movements necessary to accomplish this task are as follows:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the ketchup bottle. This involves navigating to the approximate location of the ketchup bottle. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** The robot needs to grasp the ketchup bottle using its gripper. This involves positioning the gripper above the bottle and closing it. (Steps 5-7)
3. **Lift and Move Ketchup:** Once grasped, the robot needs to lift the ketchup bottle and move it to the basket. (Steps 8-11)
4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** The robot needs to carefully place the ketchup bottle into the basket. This involves opening the gripper and repositioning the arm. (Steps 12-14)
