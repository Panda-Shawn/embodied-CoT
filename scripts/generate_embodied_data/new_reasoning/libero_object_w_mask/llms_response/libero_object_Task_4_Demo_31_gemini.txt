### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle and basket were positioned such that the robot needed to move horizontally and vertically to reach and grasp the ketchup bottle, and then repeat these movements to place the bottle in the basket. The environment contained at least a table or surface holding the ketchup bottle and a basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Ketchup:** This involves moving towards the ketchup bottle and grasping it with the gripper.  (Steps 0-4)
2. **Lift Ketchup:**  This involves lifting the grasped ketchup bottle vertically. (Steps 5-7)
3. **Move Ketchup to Basket:** This involves moving the ketchup bottle horizontally and vertically towards the basket. (Steps 8-13)
4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** This involves lowering the ketchup bottle into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 14-24)
5. **Retreat:**  This involves moving away from the basket after placing the ketchup. (Steps 25-27)
