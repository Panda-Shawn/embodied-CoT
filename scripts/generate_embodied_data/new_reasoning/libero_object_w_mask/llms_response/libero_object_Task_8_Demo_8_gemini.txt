## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the chocolate pudding bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contained a basket on the floor and several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the intended outcome of transferring the chocolate pudding bottle from its initial location to the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the pudding bottle, grasping the bottle, lifting the bottle, moving to the basket, and placing the bottle in the basket.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Pudding Bottle:** Steps 0-6.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the chocolate pudding bottle to grasp it.  The robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach the pudding.

2. **Grasp Pudding Bottle:** Steps 4-6. This was essential to secure the chocolate pudding bottle for the subsequent lifting and transportation to the basket.  The gripper needed to be closed around the bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport to Basket:** Steps 7-13. This involved lifting the pudding bottle and moving it to the approximate location of the basket, accounting for potential obstacles.

4. **Position over Basket:** Steps 13-14.  This precise positioning ensures the bottle is dropped directly into the basket.

5. **Place Pudding Bottle in Basket:** Steps 14-17. The robot opens the gripper to release the bottle into the basket.


6. **Return to Home Position**: Steps 18-19.  This is a standard post-task motion to prepare the robot for a new task.
