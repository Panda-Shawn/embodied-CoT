## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, presumably a table or counter, and the basket was in a different location. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed was:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** The robot moved to a position above the orange juice bottle. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** The robot lowered its gripper to grasp the orange juice bottle. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Lift Orange Juice:** The robot lifted the orange juice bottle. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Transport Orange Juice:** The robot moved the orange juice bottle to the basket. (Steps 11-12)
5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** The robot lowered the orange juice bottle into the basket and released it. (Steps 13-16)
