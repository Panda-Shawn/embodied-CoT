## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The tomato sauce was initially located on a surface, requiring the robot to approach it, grasp it, lift it, and then navigate to the basket's location. The basket was assumed to be positioned some distance away from the tomato sauce, requiring translational and rotational movement. The primary activity was the manipulation of the tomato sauce bottle, with the intended outcome being its safe transfer from the surface to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the tomato sauce, grasping the sauce, lifting the sauce, moving to the basket, and placing the sauce into the basket.


The high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges are:

1. **Approach Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-4.  This was necessary to bring the robotic arm into a position to grasp the tomato sauce bottle.  The robot needed to navigate around any obstacles and position itself appropriately for the next action.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 5-9. This was crucial for securing the bottle of sauce before lifting it. This involved moving the arm downwards and closing the gripper.

3. **Lift Tomato Sauce:** Steps 10-12. This movement raised the tomato sauce off the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 13-15.  This involved moving the arm towards the location of the basket.

5. **Place Tomato Sauce in Basket:** Steps 16-18. This involved lowering the arm and releasing the sauce into the basket.


6. **Return to Rest Position:** Steps 19-20. This is a post-task action.
