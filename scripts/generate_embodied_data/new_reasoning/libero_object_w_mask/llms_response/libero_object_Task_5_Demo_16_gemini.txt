## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved retrieving a carton of tomato sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other items: milk and butter on a table, orange juice and chocolate pudding on the floor. The primary activity was manipulation â€“ grasping and transporting the tomato sauce. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the tomato sauce inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the tomato sauce.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** This stage involved precise maneuvering to position the gripper over the sauce and securely grasp it. (Steps 4-9)
3. **Lift and transport the tomato sauce:** The robot raised the sauce to a clear height for transport. (Steps 10-12)
4. **Approach the basket:** The robot moved to the basket's location. (Steps 13-15)
5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This involved precise positioning and release of the sauce into the basket. (Steps 16-19)
