## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, presumably a table or counter, and the basket was positioned some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, lift it, and then transport it to the basket before releasing it. The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot was:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** The robot needed to move to a position where it could reach the orange juice bottle. (Steps 0-3)

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** The robot had to position its gripper over the orange juice and securely grasp it. (Steps 4-6)

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** The robot needed to lift the orange juice bottle and move it to the basket. (Steps 7-10)

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** The robot had to position the orange juice bottle within the basket and release its grip. (Steps 11-15)
