## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle was assumed to be positioned to the right and slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was assumed to be to the left and somewhat forward of the starting position. The primary activity was the manipulation of the orange juice bottle, and the intended outcome was to successfully transfer the bottle from its initial location to the basket without dropping it. The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the orange juice    | 1-5         | To position the robot arm for grasping the orange juice bottle.                                            |
| Grasp the orange juice       | 6-8         | To securely hold the orange juice bottle in the gripper.                                                |
| Lift the orange juice       | 8-10        | To lift the bottle clear of the surface.  Incorporates tilting for stability during lift.              |
| Transport to the basket     | 11-13       | To move the bottle to the approximate location of the basket.                                           |
| Position above the basket   | 13-15       | To precisely position the bottle above the basket for controlled placement.                              |
| Place the orange juice in the basket | 14-17      | To gently release the orange juice bottle into the basket while maintaining stability.  Incorporates opening gripper and tilting up for better placement control.         |
| Stop                          | 18         | To conclude the task.                                                                                   |
