## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered surface and placing it in a nearby basket. The environment included a wooden surface with various food items scattered around: BBQ sauce, basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The BBQ sauce was initially located near other objects, not in the basket. The goal was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle and place it inside the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-10) This involved navigating the robot arm to a position above the BBQ sauce bottle, avoiding obstacles and positioning the gripper for pickup.  This phase was necessary to bring the robot arm into a suitable configuration to interact with the BBQ sauce.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 11-12) This involved closing the gripper around the BBQ sauce bottle to securely hold it.  This was essential for successfully picking up the bottle.

3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 13-14) This involved raising the BBQ sauce bottle to a height sufficient to clear any obstacles for transport to the basket.  Lifting the bottle cleared the path for movement to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 15-17) This involved moving the robotic arm with the BBQ sauce to a position above the basket.  This step was necessary to position the bottle correctly above the basket for placement.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 18-20) This involved lowering the bottle into the basket and releasing the grip. This was the final step to complete the task.
