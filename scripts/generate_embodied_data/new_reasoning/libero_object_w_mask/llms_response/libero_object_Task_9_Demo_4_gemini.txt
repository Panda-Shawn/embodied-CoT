## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was situated on a surface, requiring the robot arm to navigate to its location, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to a basket positioned elsewhere. The basket is assumed to be within reach after the orange juice is picked up. The general sequence involved approaching the orange juice, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, and then releasing it into the basket.


Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 0-4. This involved maneuvering the robotic arm into position above the orange juice bottle. This was necessary to get the arm within reach of the bottle before attempting to grasp it.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 5-7. This involved activating the gripper to secure the orange juice bottle. This was essential to prepare for lifting the object and transferring it.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** Steps 8-9. The arm lifts the orange juice after the gripper is closed. This was necessary to clear the orange juice from the surface before transport to the basket.

4. **Move Orange Juice to Basket:** Steps 9-12. This moved the orange juice towards the basket's location.  This movement is needed to transport the object to its destination.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 12-15. This involved lowering the orange juice into the basket and releasing it. This was the final step in completing the task successfully.
