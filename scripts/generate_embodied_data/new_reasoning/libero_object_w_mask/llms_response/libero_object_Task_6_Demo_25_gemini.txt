## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it in a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the floor to the basket.  The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (also on the floor). The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it securely, then move to the basket and release the butter into it.  The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach Butter:** The robot needed to move to a position above the butter, preparing to grasp it. This involved a combination of translation and potentially orientation adjustments.  This likely corresponds to steps 0-4.
2. **Grasp Butter:** The robot's gripper had to close around the butter to secure a grip. This required precise positioning and gripper actuation. Steps 5-8 seem to represent this phase.
3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** The butter had to be lifted from the floor and moved to a position above the basket. This involved upward movement and potentially translation. This corresponds to steps 9-12.
4. **Place Butter in Basket:** The robot needed to release the butter into the basket by opening the gripper. Steps 13-19 seem to represent this phase.
