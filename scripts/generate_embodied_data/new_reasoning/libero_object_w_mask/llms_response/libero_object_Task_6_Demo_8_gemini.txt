## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from a surface and placing it into a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other objects: bottles of sauce (likely ketchup, bbq sauce, and orange juice), a can of tomato sauce, all on the floor, and a bottle of ketchup on a table. The butter's exact location isn't specified but is implied to be accessible to the robotic arm. The basket is also on the floor.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can reach the butter. This involves moving right and forward to overcome any distance and potential obstacles.

2. **Pick up the butter:** (Steps 6-10) The robot lowers itself and closes its gripper to grasp the butter.  The movements here suggest a descending approach and secure gripping.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 12-16) The robot lifts the butter, moves towards the basket's general location, potentially adjusting its position to avoid obstacles and prepare for placement.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 17-18) The robot carefully positions the butter over the basket and opens its gripper to release it. The rotation suggests orienting the butter for proper placement.

5. **Return to a resting position:** (Steps 20-21) The robot moves to a safe and stable configuration after completing the task.
