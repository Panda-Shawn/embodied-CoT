## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained various food items: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, scattered on a wooden surface. The initial location of the BBQ sauce is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory suggests it was not initially in the basket.  The primary activity was a two-stage process:  (1) locating and grasping the BBQ sauce, and (2) transporting the BBQ sauce to the basket and releasing it.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 0-8.  This involved navigating to the BBQ sauce's location and securely grasping it with the gripper.

2. **Transport BBQ Sauce to Basket:** Steps 9-16.  This phase consisted of lifting the BBQ sauce, moving it towards the basket, and preparing for placement.

3. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 17-29. This phase involved lowering the BBQ sauce into the basket, releasing it, and retracting the arm.
