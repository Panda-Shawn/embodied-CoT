## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it in a basket. The environment included a wooden surface with several objects: bbq sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The BBQ sauce was initially located on the table near other items, and the basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate through the cluttered workspace to reach the BBQ sauce, grasp it carefully, lift it, and then move to the basket to deposit it. The high-level movements likely followed are:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:**  Steps 0-6. This involved navigating to the BBQ sauce, maneuvering around other objects, and positioning the gripper for grasping.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 5-6. This involved closing the gripper around the BBQ sauce bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** Steps 7-9. This involved lifting the BBQ sauce and moving it toward the basket.

4. **Approach Basket:** Steps 9-11. This stage included positioning the robot arm over the basket.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 11-15. This involved lowering the BBQ sauce into the basket and opening the gripper to release it.
