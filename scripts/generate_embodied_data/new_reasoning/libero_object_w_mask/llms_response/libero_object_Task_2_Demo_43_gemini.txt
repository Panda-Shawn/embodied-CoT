## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up the salad dressing and placing it in the basket. The robot operated in an environment containing a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup near the basket, milk and cream cheese on a table (irrelevant to this task), and alphabet soup and tomato sauce on the floor (also irrelevant).  The primary activity was a targeted object manipulation: selecting the salad dressing bottle from its location on the floor near the basket and then transporting it to the basket and depositing it inside. The intended outcome was to have the salad dressing bottle successfully inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing bottle. This involved moving towards the general area where the dressing was located.

2. **Pick up Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-8) Once in the vicinity of the salad dressing, the robot had to grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-13)  The robot needed to move the salad dressing from its original position to the basket. This required careful maneuvering to avoid obstacles and maintain a stable grasp.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 14-16) The robot had to release the salad dressing into the basket.

5. **Post-Placement Adjustment (Optional):** (Steps 17-19) A slight adjustment to position might have been necessary.
