## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle from the table and place it in the basket.  The environment contains a wooden surface with various food items: BBQ sauce, a basket (presumably empty at the start), chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The BBQ sauce bottle is initially on the table, and the basket is also on the table (the exact relative positions aren't specified but are inferred from the trajectory).  The robot needs to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket, placing it inside.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-4)  The robot moves towards the BBQ sauce bottle, likely adjusting its position to get a good approach angle. This is necessary to position itself for the next steps of picking up the sauce.

2. **Pick Up BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-9) The robot lowers its arm, tilts its gripper, and closes its gripper around the BBQ sauce bottle. This ensures a secure grip.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 11-15) The robot lifts the BBQ sauce bottle and moves it towards the basket, making necessary adjustments to clear obstacles. This ensures the safe transport of the BBQ sauce.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 16-19) The robot positions the bottle over the basket and releases it, ensuring the BBQ sauce is placed inside the basket.

5. **Return to Resting Position:** (Steps 21-24) The robot returns to its resting position. This is a standard safety procedure and good practice after task completion.
