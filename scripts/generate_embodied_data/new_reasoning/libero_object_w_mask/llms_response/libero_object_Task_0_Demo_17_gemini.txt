## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it in a basket located on the same table.  The alphabet soup was situated amongst other food items: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce, all on the table. Butter was located elsewhere. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movements to avoid colliding with other objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the alphabet soup from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-4)  This involved navigating the robot arm to a position directly above the alphabet soup, avoiding obstacles like other food items.  This was necessary to prepare for grasping the soup.

2. **Grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 5-6)  The robot needed to position its gripper precisely over the soup and then close the gripper to secure a firm hold.

3. **Lift the alphabet soup:** (Steps 7-8) This step was crucial to clear the alphabet soup from the table and avoid collision with other objects while beginning the transportation to the basket.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 9-13) The robot needed to transport the soup to the basket's location, carefully avoiding collisions with the other food items on the table.

5. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** (Steps 14-17) This involved precisely positioning the soup above the basket, opening the gripper to release it, and then moving away to a safe distance.
