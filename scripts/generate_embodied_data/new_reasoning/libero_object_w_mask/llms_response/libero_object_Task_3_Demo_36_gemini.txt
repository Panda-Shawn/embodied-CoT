## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a countertop and placing it into a basket on the floor.  The environment contained the BBQ sauce bottle alongside bottles of ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, all situated near a basket on the floor. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, depositing it inside.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needed to position itself appropriately to reach the BBQ sauce bottle. This involved navigating through the space to get to the right location.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 4-5) The robot had to reach the BBQ sauce and securely grasp it with its gripper.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce to Basket:** (Steps 6-10) This stage required lifting the BBQ sauce, moving it over to the basket, and positioning it for placement.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot had to carefully lower the bottle into the basket and release its grip.
