## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a container of cream cheese from a basket and leaving it in the same location. The environment consisted of a table or floor with a basket containing cream cheese. Other objects (alphabet soup, milk, tomato sauce, butter, and orange juice) were present but irrelevant to the task.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the cream cheese container. The intended outcome was the cream cheese remaining in its original location within the basket.  No change in the cream cheese's position relative to the basket was intended.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the basket:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could interact with the basket and the cream cheese.  This involved moving towards the general area of the basket.

2. **Reach and grasp the cream cheese:** (Steps 4-6) Once positioned, the robot needed to extend its arm, reach the cream cheese, and secure its grasp.

3. **Return to the basket:** (Steps 7-12)  The robot needed to carefully retract its arm, ensuring the cream cheese was not dropped, back to the basket, while avoiding the other objects.

4. **Release the cream cheese:** (Steps 13-14)  The robot had to release its grip on the cream cheese, placing it back into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 15) The robot needed to move away from the basket and reach a stopped state.
