## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of orange juice and place it into a basket.  The orange juice was assumed to be on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was located some distance away, potentially requiring movement and reorientation of the arm. The robot needed to navigate to the juice, grasp it, lift it, move to the basket, and finally place the juice into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move to a position directly above the orange juice to facilitate grasping. This involved navigating any obstacles and positioning itself optimally for the next step.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-8) The robot had to lower its gripper, close it around the orange juice, and ensure a secure grasp.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot had to lift the orange juice and move towards the basket's location.  This involved a combination of vertical and horizontal movements to navigate the space between the juice and the basket.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot needed to lower the orange juice into the basket, open its gripper to release the juice, and then stop.
