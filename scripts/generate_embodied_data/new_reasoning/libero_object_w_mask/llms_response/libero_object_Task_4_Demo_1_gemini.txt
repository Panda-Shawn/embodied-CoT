## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly below the ketchup. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing it inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to move to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing to grasp it. This involved moving right, then down, and finally closing the gripper.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. The robot closed its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-8. The robot lifted the ketchup bottle upward, clearing it from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-12. The robot moved the grasped ketchup bottle toward the basket.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 12-13. The robot carefully positioned the ketchup above the basket, tilting it appropriately.

6. **Release Ketchup:** Steps 13-16. The robot released the ketchup bottle into the basket.

7. **Return to Home Position (implicitly):** Steps 16-18. The robot returned to a stop position after completing the task.
