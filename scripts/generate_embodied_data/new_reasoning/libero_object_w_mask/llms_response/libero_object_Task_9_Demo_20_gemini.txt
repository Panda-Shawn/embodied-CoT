## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was at a different location. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself in front of the orange juice bottle.  This involves moving forward until it is in a suitable position to grasp the bottle.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-10) The robot must lower its arm and close its gripper to securely hold the orange juice bottle.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needs to lift the orange juice bottle up, ensuring a safe and stable grip.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 14-23) The robot must move to the location of the basket, potentially involving moving forward, down, and then adjusting its position.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 24-27) The robot must lower the orange juice bottle into the basket and release its grip.
