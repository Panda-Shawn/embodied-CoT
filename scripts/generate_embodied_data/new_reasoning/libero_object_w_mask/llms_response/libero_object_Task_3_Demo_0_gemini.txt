## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained several objects on a table or floor: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, cream cheese, and alphabet soup. The BBQ sauce was located near the basket, facilitating a relatively straightforward pick-and-place operation. The chocolate pudding was next to the ketchup, the salad dressing was near the cream cheese, and the alphabet soup was in a corner â€“ these locations were irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-6)  The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position to grasp the BBQ sauce. This involved navigating around other objects and positioning its gripper appropriately.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-8) This involves closing the gripper around the BBQ sauce.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-15)  The robot lifted the BBQ sauce and moved it towards the basket. This involved adjustments to account for the robot arm's orientation and the basket's location.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 16-21) The robot placed the BBQ sauce into the basket and then retracted its arm.
