## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a location within a wicker basket and placing it in the same basket.  The environment included a wicker basket on the floor, a bottle of BBQ sauce already inside the basket, a bottle of ketchup, a bottle of salad dressing, and a bottle of alphabet soup also on the floor, and a can of cream cheese on a table.  The robot's goal was to pick up the BBQ sauce (already in the basket) and place it *back* in the basket â€“ this implies the sauce may have been slightly dislodged or the robot needed to demonstrate precise manipulation. The high-level movements likely followed were:

1. **Approach the Basket:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to position itself close enough to the basket to interact with the BBQ sauce.

2. **Pick up the BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot had to lower its gripper to grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift the BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 9-12) The robot had to raise the bottle after grasping it.

4. **(Optional) Re-position the BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 13-17) This may represent a minor adjustment of the sauce's position within the gripper, ensuring a secure hold.

5. **Place the BBQ Sauce back into the Basket:** (Steps 18-24) The robot needed to carefully place the BBQ sauce back within the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 25-27) The robot moves away from the basket after completing the task.
