## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of orange juice from a surface and place it in a basket.  We assume the orange juice is in a carton or bottle, and the basket is within reach of the robotic arm.  The orange juice is positioned to the right and slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket is behind and slightly to the left of the orange juice.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to move to a position where it can grasp the orange juice. This involves moving forward and slightly to the right, then down to reach the juice container's grasping point.  The closing of the gripper is the final action in this stage.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-7)  The gripper closes to secure the orange juice container.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** (Steps 7-9) The robot lifts the orange juice container.  The upward and leftward movements position the container for transport.

4. **Transport Orange Juice:** (Steps 9-12) The robot moves the orange juice towards the basket. This involves moving left and then downward to a stable position before placing it.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot positions itself above the basket.  A tilt is used to ensure accurate placement.

6. **Release Orange Juice:** (Steps 17-20) The robot opens the gripper to release the juice container into the basket.
