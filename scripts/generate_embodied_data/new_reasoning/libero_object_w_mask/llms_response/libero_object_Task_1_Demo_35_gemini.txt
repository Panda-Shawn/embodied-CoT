### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located on a surface, and the basket is positioned somewhere else in the robot's workspace.  The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it into the basket. This involves a series of movements including approach, grasping, lifting, transportation, and releasing.


We can identify the following high-level movements from the trajectory:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-6. The robot needs to move to a position above the cream cheese container to allow for grasping. This involves navigating around potential obstacles.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 7-8.  The robot needs to position its gripper and close it around the cream cheese.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 9-10. The robot needs to lift the cream cheese container from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-13. The robot needs to move to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-18. The robot needs to position the cream cheese above the basket and release it.
