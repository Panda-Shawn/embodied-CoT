## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of tomato sauce and place it in a basket.  The environment contains a basket on the floor, milk and butter on a table (irrelevant to this task), an orange juice carton, and a chocolate pudding carton on the floor. The tomato sauce is assumed to be on the floor, near the other items. The robot needs to navigate to the tomato sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements would involve: approaching the tomato sauce, grasping the tomato sauce, lifting the tomato sauce, moving to the basket, and placing the tomato sauce in the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are as follows:

1. **Approach Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-5.  This involves navigating to a position near the tomato sauce, likely adjusting orientation to prepare for grasping.  This is necessary to bring the robot arm into a position suitable for picking up the sauce.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 6-8. This involves moving the gripper downwards and closing it to secure the sauce. This is essential to successfully pick up the sauce.

3. **Lift Tomato Sauce:** Steps 9-11. This involves lifting the sauce clear of the surface. This is required to move the sauce without dragging it along the floor.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 12-14. This involves moving the robot arm horizontally and downwards towards the basket. This is necessary to position the sauce above the basket.

5. **Place Tomato Sauce:** Steps 15-17. This involves lowering the sauce into the basket and releasing it.  This action achieves the primary goal of the task.

6. **Return:** Steps 18-19. This is an optional step. This involves moving up slightly after placement.  While not strictly necessary for successful task completion, it shows a safe and potentially efficient way of completing the task.
