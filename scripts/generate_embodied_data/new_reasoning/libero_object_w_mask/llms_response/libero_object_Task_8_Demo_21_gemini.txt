## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the chocolate pudding and place it in the basket.  The robot operated in an environment containing several objects on a flat surface: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The chocolate pudding and basket were initially separate, with the pudding's exact location relative to the basket and other items unspecified but implied to require arm movement to reach. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the pudding, grasping the pudding, lifting the pudding, moving to the basket, and placing the pudding into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 1-8)  The robot needed to maneuver its arm to a position above the chocolate pudding to be able to grip it. This involved a series of movements to position the arm correctly.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-7)  The robot needed to close its gripper around the pudding to securely hold it.  This requires accurate positioning, and careful control to avoid damaging the pudding or knocking over other items.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 9-12) The robot needed to lift the pudding clear of the surface without spilling or dropping it. This requires a controlled upward movement.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 13-18) The robot needed to transport the pudding to the basket's location. This likely involved a combination of movements and rotations to navigate around other objects.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 19-22) The robot needed to precisely position the pudding within the basket. This requires opening the gripper and careful lowering and alignment.


6. **Return to Home Position:** (Steps 23-36) This phase involves repositioning the arm after completing the task, ensuring safety and readiness for further instructions.
