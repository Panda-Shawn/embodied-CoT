## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle from the table and place it in the basket.  The environment contained a wooden surface with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The BBQ sauce bottle was initially located on the table near other items. The basket was also on the table. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, the intended outcome being the BBQ sauce bottle inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-6)  The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the BBQ sauce bottle.  This involved a series of forward movements, possibly adjusting its position to avoid obstacles.

2. **Pick Up BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-11) The robot had to lower its arm, position itself over the BBQ sauce bottle, and grasp it securely.  Tilting the gripper upwards likely assisted in successfully securing the bottle.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 13-17)  The robot needed to transport the BBQ sauce bottle to the basket.  This would involve moving upwards (clearing obstacles), then moving to the left (towards the basket).  More downward movement is required to lower to the height of the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 18-22)  The robot had to position the bottle above the basket, open its gripper to release it, and then retract its arm.

5. **Stop:** (Steps 0, 12, 23) The robot initiates and stops it's actions at the beginning and end of the task, and between the pick and place actions.
