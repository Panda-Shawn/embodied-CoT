## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and place it into a basket.  The orange juice bottle was situated on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned to the left and slightly above the initial location of the orange juice bottle.  The primary activity involved manipulating the robotic arm to grasp the bottle and then transport it to the designated basket, placing it inside.  The objects involved are the robotic arm, the orange juice bottle, and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the orange juice:** This involved moving the robotic arm towards the orange juice bottle, positioning it for grasping. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the orange juice:** This stage focused on closing the gripper around the bottle. (Step 4)
3. **Lift the orange juice:** The robot needed to lift the bottle after grasping it. (Step 5-6)
4. **Move to the basket:**  The arm moved towards the basket's location. (Steps 7-9)
5. **Place the orange juice in the basket:**  This involved positioning the bottle and releasing it into the basket. (Steps 10-14)
