## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it into a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is also within reach, but potentially at a different location. The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and then release the cream cheese into the basket.

The likely high-level movements the robot followed are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4. This involves moving the arm to a position above and slightly in front of the cream cheese, positioning it for grasping.
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. This involves lowering the arm to make contact with the cream cheese and closing the gripper to secure it.
3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-7. This involves lifting the arm upward to lift the cream cheese from the surface.
4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-17. This involves moving the arm to a position above the basket.
5. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 17-18. Fine positioning above the basket to prepare for placing the cream cheese.
6. **Place Cream Cheese:** Steps 18-20.  This involves carefully lowering the arm, opening the gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.
7. **Retract Arm:** Steps 20-21.  This involves moving the arm away from the basket.
