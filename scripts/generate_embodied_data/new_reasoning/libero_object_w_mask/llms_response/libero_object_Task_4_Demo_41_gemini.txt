## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle and the basket were presumably located on a flat surface within the robot's reachable workspace. The robot needed to navigate its arm to the ketchup bottle's location, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket's location before carefully placing it down.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the ketchup, grasping the ketchup, lifting the ketchup, moving to the basket, and placing the ketchup in the basket.

High-level movements identified from the trajectory:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-2.  This was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the ketchup bottle to grasp it. The robot needed to move towards the ketchup to be in range of grabbing it.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Step 3. This involved closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle to secure a hold. This is a necessary step to pick up the ketchup.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 4-6.  This involved lifting the ketchup bottle vertically after successfully grasping it. This movement gets the ketchup bottle away from the table after grabbing it.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-9. This involved moving the arm horizontally and downwards to bring the ketchup closer to the basket.  Moving to the basket location before dropping off the ketchup.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 10-13. This involved positioning the ketchup over the basket and releasing it carefully. This final high-level movement includes carefully placing the ketchup into the basket and ends the task.
