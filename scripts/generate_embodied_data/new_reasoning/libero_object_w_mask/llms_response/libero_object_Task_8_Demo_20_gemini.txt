## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other objects—orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup—were present on the table, but irrelevant to the task. The chocolate pudding and basket had specific, unknown spatial relationships relative to each other and other objects.  The robot needed to navigate the cluttered table surface to successfully achieve the goal.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Pudding:** (Steps 0-6)  The robot needed to move to the pudding's location and pick it up. This involved navigating around other objects on the table to reach the pudding's position.

2. **Lift and Transport Pudding:** (Steps 7-9) The robot lifted the pudding after grasping it and then moved to a position that is suitable for transferring it to the basket.

3. **Place Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 10-16) The robot navigated to the basket's location, positioned the pudding, and placed it inside. This potentially involved aligning the pudding with the basket.

4. **Retreat and Stop:** (Steps 17-19)  The robot moved away from the basket after successfully placing the pudding.
