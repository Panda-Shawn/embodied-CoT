## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface in front of the robot, and the basket was located to the side and slightly further away. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and place it gently inside.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3. The robot needed to move to a position directly above the cream cheese to be able to grasp it. This involved navigating forward and adjusting its orientation.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. This involved descending towards the cream cheese and closing its gripper around it.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 7-9.  The robot needed to lift the cream cheese off the surface to facilitate moving it to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-12.  The robot needed to move the cream cheese to a position above the basket to facilitate placing it gently inside.

5. **Place Cream Cheese:** Steps 13-16. This involved carefully placing the cream cheese in the basket by lowering it and opening the gripper.

6. **Return to a Stop:** Step 17. The robot returns to a stationary and safe posture after the completion of the task.
