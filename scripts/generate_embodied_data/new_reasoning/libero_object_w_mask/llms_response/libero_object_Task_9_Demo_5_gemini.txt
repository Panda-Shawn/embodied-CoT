## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it in a basket.  The orange juice is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robot arm, and the basket is located at a different position, also within reach.  The robot needs to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to move itself into a position where it can reach the orange juice bottle. This involves moving forward and slightly adjusting its position for optimal grasping.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 5-8) The robot lowers itself to the level of the orange juice, and closes its gripper to securely grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot lifts the orange juice and then moves to the location of the basket.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot lowers the orange juice into the basket and releases it.
