## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table or floor and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained the BBQ sauce bottle, along with several other condiment bottles (ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, chocolate pudding) and a cream cheese can, all situated near a basket on the floor. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-4) The robot moves towards the BBQ sauce bottle.  This is necessary to get into a position to grasp it.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-9) The robot lowers itself, aligns its gripper with the BBQ sauce, and then closes its gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-15)  The robot lifts the BBQ sauce and moves it towards the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 16-18) The robot lowers the BBQ sauce into the basket and releases its grip.
