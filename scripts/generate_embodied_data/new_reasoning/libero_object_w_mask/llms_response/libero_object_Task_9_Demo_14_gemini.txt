## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The orange juice bottle was situated on a surface, and the basket was located some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket, and carefully place it inside.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** The robot needed to move to a position close enough to the orange juice to grasp it.
2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** The robot needed to use its gripper to securely grasp the bottle.
3. **Lift Orange Juice:** The robot needed to lift the bottle from the surface.
4. **Move Orange Juice to Basket:** The robot needed to transport the bottle to the location of the basket.
5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** The robot needed to carefully place the bottle inside the basket.

Based on the trajectory, the likely high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges are:


| High-Level Movement        | Step Range | Justification                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach Orange Juice       | 0-3        | To get into position for grasping the orange juice.                             |
| Grasp Orange Juice         | 4-7        | To secure the bottle for lifting.                                             |
| Lift Orange Juice          | 8-9        | To raise the orange juice off the surface.                                    |
| Move Orange Juice to Basket | 10-12      | To transport the orange juice to the basket's vicinity.                         |
| Place Orange Juice in Basket | 13-17     | To carefully deposit the orange juice into the basket and release the grip. |
