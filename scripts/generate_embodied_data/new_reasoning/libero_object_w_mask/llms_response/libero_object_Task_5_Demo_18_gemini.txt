1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of tomato sauce from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce was assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was located at a separate position also within reach. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it.


The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-9. The robot needs to approach the tomato sauce bottle and position itself to grasp it. This involves navigating through the workspace and positioning its gripper directly above the sauce bottle.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 10-11. The robot executes the action of grasping the tomato sauce bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport Sauce to Basket:** Steps 11-18.  The robot lifts the grasped sauce bottle and moves it to the basket's location. This likely involves navigating around obstacles and positioning the sauce bottle for placement.

4. **Place Sauce in Basket:** Steps 18-23. The robot places the sauce into the basket. This requires aligning the sauce over the basket and releasing its grip.
