## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it in a basket located on the same surface.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere.  The primary activity was manipulation of the alphabet soup container, requiring precise movements to avoid contacting other objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the soup from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to grasp the soup.  This involved moving towards the general area of the soup container.

2. **Grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 3-5)  The robot had to reach the soup and securely grasp it using its gripper.

3. **Lift and transport the alphabet soup:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifted the soup container and moved it to the basket.

4. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** (Steps 9-12) This involved positioning the container above the basket and releasing the grip.

5. **Retreat and stop:** (Steps 13-14) The robot moved away from the basket and stopped to signal task completion.
