## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the table and placing it in a basket, also located on the table.  Other objects present on the table included orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup.  The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully grasp the pudding and move it to the basket.  The pudding's exact location relative to the other items and the basket wasn't explicitly specified, but the trajectory implies a spatial arrangement that requires a series of movements to achieve the goal.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Pudding:**  (Steps 1-6)  The robot needed to move to the pudding's location, position itself correctly, and then grip the pudding. This stage requires maneuvering through the cluttered environment to avoid collisions.

2. **Lift and Transport Pudding:** (Steps 7-10) This involves lifting the pudding, carefully clearing the gripper's path, while maintaining a secure grasp to prevent dropping the pudding.

3. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 11-13) Precise positioning is crucial here, aligning the pudding above the basket's opening to facilitate the next step.

4. **Release Pudding into Basket:** (Steps 14-15) This involves opening the gripper to release the pudding, ensuring it lands safely inside the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 16-18) A final step to pull the robotic arm away from the basket to prevent any accidental knocking over.
