## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle was located on a surface to the right and slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly behind the initial position of the robot.  The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 1-7.  The robot needed to move towards the orange juice bottle to be within reach of its gripper.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 7-8. The robot needed to close its gripper around the orange juice bottle to securely hold it.

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** Steps 9-12. The robot lifted the bottle after grasping it and then moved it towards the basket.

4. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 12-13. The robot precisely positioned itself above the basket to allow for the controlled placement of the orange juice bottle.

5. **Release Orange Juice:** Steps 14-16. The robot opened its gripper to release the orange juice bottle into the basket.
