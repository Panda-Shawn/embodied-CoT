## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it into a basket on the floor.  The environment contained several other items: bottles of sauce (ketchup, BBQ sauce, orange juice, and chocolate pudding), and a can of tomato sauce, all situated on the floor. The basket was on the floor, with the ketchup and BBQ sauce bottles positioned nearby. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and control to avoid collisions with other objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the butter from its initial location to the basket without damaging the butter or the surrounding objects.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the butter, avoiding obstacles.  (Steps 1-3)
2. **Pick up the butter:** This involved precise positioning above the butter and closing the gripper to secure it. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the butter:** This involved raising the butter to a safe height, clearing it from the surface and other objects. (Steps 8-9)
4. **Move to the basket:** This involved navigating to the basket, avoiding collisions. (Steps 10-12)
5. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involved lowering the butter into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 14-15)
