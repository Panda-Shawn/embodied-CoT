## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the ketchup bottle from the floor and place it in a basket, also located on the floor.  Several other condiment bottles (bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk) are also present on the floor, implying a cluttered environment. The robot needs to navigate this environment to selectively pick up the ketchup bottle and avoid collisions with other objects. The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory to be:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** The robot moves to a position above the ketchup bottle, positioning itself for grasping.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** The robot uses its gripper to securely grasp the ketchup bottle.
3. **Lift Ketchup:** The robot lifts the ketchup bottle from the floor.
4. **Navigate to Basket:** The robot moves the grasped ketchup bottle to a position above the basket.
5. **Place Ketchup:** The robot carefully places the ketchup bottle into the basket.

These high-level movements can be mapped to the trajectory steps as follows:

* **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-5
* **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 6-7
* **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 8-14
* **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 10-14
* **Place Ketchup:** Steps 15-20
