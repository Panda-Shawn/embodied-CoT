## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the bottle of BBQ sauce and place it in the wicker basket.  The BBQ sauce is located on the floor next to the basket. Other items are present in the environment: ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese, all situated near the BBQ sauce and basket.  The basket is also on the floor. The primary activity is manipulation; the intended outcome is the successful transfer of the BBQ sauce from its initial location to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** Steps 0-6. The robot moves to a position above the BBQ sauce, preparing to grasp it. Justification: This is necessary to get the robot's arm into a position to pick up the object.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 7-10. The robot closes its gripper around the BBQ sauce. Justification: This action is required to secure the BBQ sauce for transport.

3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** Steps 11-13. The robot lifts the BBQ sauce. Justification: It is necessary to raise the BBQ sauce clear of the floor and other objects.

4. **Move BBQ Sauce to Basket:** Steps 13-24. The robot moves the BBQ sauce towards and above the basket. Justification: This is required to position the BBQ sauce for placement into the basket.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 25-27. The robot opens its gripper, releasing the BBQ sauce into the basket. Justification: This is the final step to complete the task.
