## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was initially positioned somewhat to the robot's right and slightly lower than its starting position. The basket was located to the robot's left and somewhat further away.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and finally deposit it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-6)  The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the ketchup bottle. This involved a series of movements to position itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 6-7) The robot closes its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 8-10) The robot lifts the ketchup bottle to avoid collision with the surface during transportation.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-14)  The robot transports the ketchup to the basket.  This involved a longer trajectory to reach the basket.

5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** (Steps 14-19) The robot lowers the ketchup into the basket, releases its grasp and repositioned itself slightly to make the placement smoother.

6. **Return to original position** (Steps 20-21) The robot returns to a suitable resting position
