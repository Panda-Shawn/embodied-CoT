## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a white wicker basket, also situated on the floor.  The butter and basket were adjacent to each other.  Other objects were present on the floor or a table, but they were irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to grasp the butter. This involved moving closer to the butter and basket.

2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 3-6)  The robot had to maneuver its gripper to accurately grasp the butter.

3. **Lift and transport the butter:** (Steps 8-10) Once the butter was grasped, the robot needed to lift it and move it towards the basket.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot had to position the butter above the basket and release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 15) The robot moved away to a stop position, completing the task.
