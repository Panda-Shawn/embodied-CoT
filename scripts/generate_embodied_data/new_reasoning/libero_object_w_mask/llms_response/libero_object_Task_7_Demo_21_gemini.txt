## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from its location and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was presumably located on a surface, and the basket was positioned elsewhere in the robot's workspace. The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then release it into the basket. This involved a series of movements including approaching the milk carton, grasping it, lifting it, moving to the basket, positioning above the basket, carefully lowering the carton into the basket, and finally retracting.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-3.  This involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position directly above the milk carton, preparing for grasping.  The arm moved right, then right and down to get closer to the desired location. It then moved down further and closed the gripper to prepare for grasping.


2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 3-4. This involved closing the gripper around the milk carton. The previous down movement positioned the gripper optimally, and then the gripper closed.


3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 4-6.  After securely grasping the milk carton, the arm needed to lift the carton from the surface.  This involved moving the arm upwards.


4. **Transport Milk Carton to Basket:** Steps 6-11.  The robot needed to move to the basketâ€™s general area.  The arm moved towards the left and upward to start navigating. The movements left and slightly forward suggest a path towards the basket


5. **Position above Basket:** Steps 11-14.  To accurately place the milk carton in the basket, the arm needed to be positioned directly above the basket's opening. These steps involved more fine-grained movements, combining left, down movements with counterclockwise rotation to align precisely above the basket.


6. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 14-17. The milk carton was carefully lowered into the basket. This involved moving the arm down, opening the gripper, and then moving right and down, continuing the open gripper movement.


7. **Retract:** Steps 17-19. The arm retracts, moving right and opening the gripper fully to ensure the carton was fully released before moving away from the basket.
