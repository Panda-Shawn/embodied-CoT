## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The orange juice bottle was assumed to be on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was located some distance away, requiring the arm to move to a new location. The robot needed to accurately grasp the bottle without damaging it and precisely place it in the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp:** The robot needed to move towards the orange juice bottle, position itself correctly for grasping, and then grasp the bottle. (Steps 1-7)
2. **Lift and Transport:** With the bottle grasped, the robot needed to lift the bottle, move to the basket's location, and maintain a stable grip during transport. (Steps 8-11)
3. **Place and Release:**  The robot needed to carefully position the bottle within the basket and then release its grip. (Steps 12-17)
