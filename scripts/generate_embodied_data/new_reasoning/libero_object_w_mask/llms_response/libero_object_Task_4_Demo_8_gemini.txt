## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was initially located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was positioned to the left and slightly forward of the robot's initial location. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movements to grasp the ketchup bottle without dropping it and then accurately depositing it in the basket. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the ketchup bottle from its initial position to the basket.


The high-level movements were likely as follows:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to move towards the ketchup bottle to a position suitable for grasping it. This involved approaching the bottle from the right and getting into a suitable position to pick it up.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-5. This involved closing the gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-8.  This movement lifted the ketchup bottle from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-13. The robot moved the grasped ketchup bottle to the vicinity of the basket.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 13-14. The robot precisely positioned the ketchup bottle above the basket.

6. **Release Ketchup:** Steps 15-16. The robot opened its gripper to release the ketchup bottle into the basket.

7. **Retreat:** Steps 17. The robot moved away slightly after placing the ketchup in the basket.
