## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered environment and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained a basket on the floor with alphabet soup and tomato sauce inside.  Near the basket were bottles of salad dressing and ketchup. On a table, separate from the basket, were containers of milk and cream cheese. The primary activity was to selectively grasp the salad dressing bottle, avoiding other objects, and transport it to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the salad dressing bottle inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the salad dressing without colliding with other objects.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 3-4) This involved precisely positioning the gripper over the salad dressing and closing the gripper to securely grasp the bottle.

3. **Lift and move to the basket:** (Steps 6-7)  The robot had to lift the salad dressing and move it towards the basket, avoiding obstacles.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 8-12) This entailed positioning the bottle above the basket and releasing it into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 13) The robot moved away from the basket to avoid collisions.
