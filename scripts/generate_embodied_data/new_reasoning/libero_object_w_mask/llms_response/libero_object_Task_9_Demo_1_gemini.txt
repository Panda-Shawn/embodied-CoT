## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it in a basket.  The orange juice was positioned on a surface, likely a table, within reach of the robotic arm. The basket was located at a different location, requiring the robot to move from the juice to the basket.  The robot arm had a gripper capable of grasping the bottle.  The high-level movements necessary involved:

1. **Approaching the Orange Juice:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could grasp the bottle of orange juice. This involved a series of forward and downward movements to get closer to the bottle.

2. **Grasping the Orange Juice:** (Steps 7-9) The robot needed to position its gripper around the orange juice and secure a grip.  This included adjustments to the gripper orientation and the closing of the gripper.

3. **Lifting and Moving to the Basket:** (Steps 10-15)  With the orange juice securely grasped, the robot needed to lift the bottle and move it to the location of the basket.  This included an upward movement and a movement towards the basket location, adjusting for the distance and the possible changes in height between the juice and basket.

4. **Placing the Orange Juice in the Basket:** (Steps 16-18) The robot needed to carefully position the orange juice inside the basket, requiring downward movement to deposit the orange juice, and releasing the grip on the bottle.

5. **Returning to a Rest Position:** (Steps 19) The robot returned to a stop state after completing the task.
