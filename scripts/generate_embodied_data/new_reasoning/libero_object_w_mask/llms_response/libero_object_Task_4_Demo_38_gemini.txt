## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several other objects on the same surface: bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk. The exact spatial arrangement of these objects isn't explicitly defined, but it's implied the ketchup was situated in a location requiring the robot to navigate around other items to reach it.  The basket was also located on the same surface.  The primary activity was a manipulation task, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the ketchup bottle from its initial position to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup bottle. This involved maneuvering around potential obstacles on the surface.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 4-5) The robot needed to grip the ketchup bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 6-7) Once grasped, the robot needed to lift the ketchup bottle vertically.

4. **Move Ketchup to Basket:** (Steps 7-10) The robot needed to transport the ketchup bottle to the basket, possibly again navigating around obstacles.

5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** (Steps 10-13) The robot needed to carefully place the ketchup bottle inside the basket, releasing its grip.
