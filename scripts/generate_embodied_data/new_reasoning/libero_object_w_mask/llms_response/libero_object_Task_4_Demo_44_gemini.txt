## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and below the ketchup bottle. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, releasing it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:**  Steps 0-4.  This involved moving the robot arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. This involved closing the gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.
3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-8. This involved lifting the grasped ketchup bottle.
4. **Transport Ketchup to Basket:** Steps 8-10. This involved moving the ketchup bottle towards the basket's location.
5. **Position above Basket:** Steps 10-11. This involved positioning the ketchup bottle above the basket, preparing to release it.
6. **Release Ketchup:** Steps 11-13. This involved opening the gripper to release the ketchup into the basket.
