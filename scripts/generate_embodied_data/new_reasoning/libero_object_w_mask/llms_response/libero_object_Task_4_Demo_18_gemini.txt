## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated on a surface, and the basket was located some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** The robot needed to move itself to a position where it could grasp the ketchup bottle. This involved navigating across a surface, potentially avoiding obstacles (although none are explicitly mentioned).

2. **Grasp Ketchup:**  Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to grasp the ketchup bottle using its gripper. This involves careful positioning of the gripper and closing the gripper around the bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** After grasping the ketchup, the robot needed to lift it from the surface, ensuring a secure grip to prevent dropping it.

4. **Move to Basket:**  The robot had to move to the location of the basket, carefully carrying the ketchup bottle without dropping it. This would again involve navigating.

5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:**  Having reached the basket, the robot had to carefully position the ketchup within the basket and release its grip.

Based on the provided trajectory, these high-level movements can be mapped as follows:

* **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 1-7 (movement and gripper closure)
* **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 6-7 (gripper closure)
* **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 8-10 (vertical movement)
* **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-19 (Navigation, adjusting position, with a pause)
* **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 19-24 (Positioning and gripper opening)
