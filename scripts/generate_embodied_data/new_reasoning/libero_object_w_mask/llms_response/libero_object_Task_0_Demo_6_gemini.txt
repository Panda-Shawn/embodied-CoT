## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of alphabet soup from a table and place it in a basket, also located on the table.  The environment contains several other food items on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter is located elsewhere. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the alphabet soup from its initial position to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves approaching the alphabet soup, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, placing it in the basket, and finally returning to a resting position.

Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** Steps 0-2. This movement positions the robotic arm near the alphabet soup, preparing for grasping.  It's necessary to bring the arm into a suitable position to interact with the soup container.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** Steps 3-6. This movement involves lowering the arm and closing the gripper to secure the alphabet soup. This is necessary to acquire the object.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-9. This movement raises the arm with the grasped alphabet soup and moves it towards the basket. This is necessary to transport the soup to its destination.

4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** Steps 10-13. This involves lowering the arm into the basket, opening the gripper to release the soup, and then raising the arm. This is necessary to deposit the soup and complete the task.

5. **Return to Resting Position:** Steps 14-16.  This is a final movement to bring the arm to a safe and neutral position. This ensures stability and readiness for the next task.
