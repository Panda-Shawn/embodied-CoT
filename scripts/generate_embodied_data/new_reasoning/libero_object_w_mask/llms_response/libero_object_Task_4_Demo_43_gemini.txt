## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface to the robot's front-right. The basket was positioned to the robot's left.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then navigate to the basket to deposit it.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-6. The robot needs to approach the ketchup bottle from its initial position. This involves moving closer to the bottle, adjusting its orientation to be directly above it, and preparing for grasping.


2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. The robot closes its gripper around the ketchup bottle.


3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 8-9.  The robot lifts the grasped ketchup bottle.


4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 10-13.  The robot moves the lifted ketchup bottle to a position above the basket.


5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 13-17.  The robot carefully places the ketchup bottle into the basket, then retracts.
