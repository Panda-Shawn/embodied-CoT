## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a stick of butter from the floor and place it into a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce (presumably various types), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of bbq sauce. A bottle of ketchup is located on a table, which is not relevant to this task. The primary activity is manipulation: grasping the butter and transporting it to the basket. The intended outcome is the butter being successfully placed inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** The robot needs to maneuver itself into a position where its gripper can reach the butter.  (Steps 1-4)
2. **Pick up the butter:** The robot needs to position its gripper over the butter, close the gripper to grasp it, and then lift it. (Steps 4-8)
3. **Move to the basket:** The robot needs to transport the grasped butter to the basket. (Steps 9-14)
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** The robot needs to carefully position the butter inside the basket and release it. (Steps 14-17)
