## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it into a basket on the floor. The environment contained a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, a carton of alphabet soup, a small carton of cream cheese, a small carton of milk, and a small carton of tomato sauce. The salad dressing and ketchup bottles were near the basket, the cartons were on the floor, and the milk and tomato sauce were on a table. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the salad dressing safely inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** This involved navigating to a position where the robot's arm could reach the salad dressing bottle without colliding with other objects. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the salad dressing:** The robot needed to maneuver its gripper to securely grasp the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Lift the salad dressing:** Once grasped, the robot had to lift the salad dressing bottle clear of the surrounding obstacles. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Navigate to the basket:** The robot needed to move to a position above the basket, accounting for potential obstacles. (Steps 11-12)
5. **Lower and place the salad dressing:** The robot had to carefully lower the bottle into the basket. (Steps 13-15)
6. **Retreat:** The robot needed to move away from the basket to avoid collision after placing the dressing. (Steps 16-19)
