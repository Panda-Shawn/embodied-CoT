## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other bottles (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup) besides the chocolate pudding, all positioned near the basket on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate this cluttered environment to successfully complete the task.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the chocolate pudding bottle. This involved navigating around other objects to reach the target.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 3-4)  The robot needed to securely grasp the chocolate pudding bottle using its gripper.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 5-6) The robot needed to lift the chocolate pudding bottle clear of the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 6-8) The robot needed to move the chocolate pudding to the vicinity of the basket.

5. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 8-9) The robot needed to position the chocolate pudding directly above the basket.

6. **Place Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 9-11) The robot needed to carefully place the chocolate pudding into the basket.

7. **Retreat:** (Steps 11-14) The robot needed to retract its arm to a safe position.
