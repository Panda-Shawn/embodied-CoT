## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a cluttered surface and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained several objects on a wooden surface: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The chocolate pudding was initially located away from the basket, and the other items were scattered around.  The primary activity was a transfer operation â€“ moving the chocolate pudding from its initial location to the basket. The intended outcome was to have the chocolate pudding successfully and safely inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above and close to the chocolate pudding.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** This involves lowering the gripper to securely grasp the pudding. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the Chocolate Pudding:** This involves raising the arm to lift the pudding from the surface. (Steps 7-9)
4. **Move to the Basket:** This involves moving the arm, while holding the pudding, to a position above the basket. (Steps 10-13)
5. **Place the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** This involves lowering the arm to place the pudding into the basket, and then releasing it. (Steps 14-15)
6. **Retreat:** This involves moving the arm away from the basket. (Steps 16)
