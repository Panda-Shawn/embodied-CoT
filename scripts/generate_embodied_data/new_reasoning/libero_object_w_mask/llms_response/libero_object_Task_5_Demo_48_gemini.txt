## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was initially positioned at some distance from the robot arm and the basket was located to the side of the sauce bottle. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket and release it.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-4.  This was necessary to bring the robot arm into a position where it could grasp the bottle.  The robot needed to approach the bottle in preparation for the next stage.

2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** Steps 5-8.  This involved moving the arm down to the bottle and closing the gripper to secure the bottle. The robot had to maneuver itself in order to get the gripper correctly positioned to grab the bottle.

3. **Lift and transport the tomato sauce:** Steps 9-13. This stage moved the bottle away from the initial position to avoid any collisions during movement to the basket. This stage moved the sauce bottle up and out of the way of any potential obstacles during transport.

4. **Position above the basket:** Steps 14-15. This high-level movement prepares for dropping off the sauce bottle.

5. **Release the tomato sauce:** Steps 15-17.  The robot needed to open the gripper to release the sauce bottle into the basket.

6. **Stop:** Step 17. The robot completed the task.
