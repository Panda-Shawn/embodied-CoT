## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the wooden floor/table and placing it in a basket.  The chocolate pudding, basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup were scattered on the floor or table. The primary activity was manipulation of the robotic arm to achieve the transfer of the chocolate pudding to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the chocolate pudding inside the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself appropriately above the chocolate pudding to grasp it.  This involves navigating to the pudding's location, accounting for the placement of other objects.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-5) The robot must successfully grasp the pudding using its gripper.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifts the pudding to a safe height, clearing any potential obstacles.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 9-15) The robot moves from the pudding's location to the basket's location. This movement accounts for potential obstacles, and the need for adjustments in tilting the arm based on the relative locations.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 16-18) The robot needs to position the chocolate pudding inside the basket while ensuring no spillage.  

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 19-21) The robot retracts from the basket, completing the task.
