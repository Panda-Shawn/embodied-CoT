## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at a different location, also within the arm's workspace.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and carefully place it inside without dropping it.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 1-4.  This initial movement involved navigating the robot arm toward the cream cheese container. It was necessary to position the arm correctly to be able to grasp the cream cheese effectively.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 5-9.  The robot moved its end-effector (gripper) down toward the cream cheese and closed the gripper to secure a hold. This was essential to acquire the object and successfully complete the task.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** Steps 11-16. The robot arm lifted the cream cheese from the surface and moved it across the workspace to the basket's location. This movement brought the cream cheese from its initial position to the target location.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 17-19. The robot precisely positioned the cream cheese above the basket and opened the gripper to release it into the basket. This ensures that the object is correctly placed at the destination.

5. **Retreat:** Steps 20-21.  The robot retracted to a safe distance after completing the placement. This ensures that it does not interfere with the placement and avoids any potential collisions.
