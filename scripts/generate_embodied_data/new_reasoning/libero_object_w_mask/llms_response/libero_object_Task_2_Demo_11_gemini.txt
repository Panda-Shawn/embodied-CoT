## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing and place it in the basket.  The robot operated in an environment containing a wooden surface with various food items including salad dressing, a basket, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing was initially located near other objects on the surface, while the basket was also on the surface, but at a different location.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing; the intended outcome was to have the salad dressing successfully transferred from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to move its arm to a position above the salad dressing, preparing to grasp it.
2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needed to close its gripper to securely hold the salad dressing.
3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 8-10) The robot had to lift the salad dressing vertically.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-16) The robot moved its arm to a position above the basket to place the salad dressing.
5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 16-23) The robot released the salad dressing into the basket.
