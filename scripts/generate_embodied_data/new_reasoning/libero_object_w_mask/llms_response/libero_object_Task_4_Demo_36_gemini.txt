## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it into a basket.  We assume the ketchup bottle is positioned to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position, and the basket is to the left and slightly lower than the ketchup's position. The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it.  This requires a sequence of movements involving approaching the ketchup, grasping it, lifting, moving to the basket, and releasing.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-3. The robot needs to move to the ketchup bottle to be able to grasp it.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 3-4.  The robot closes its gripper around the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 5-6. The robot lifts the ketchup bottle.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-8. The robot moves towards the basket's location.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 8-10. The robot lowers the ketchup into the basket and releases its grip.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 13-14. The robot moves away slightly.
