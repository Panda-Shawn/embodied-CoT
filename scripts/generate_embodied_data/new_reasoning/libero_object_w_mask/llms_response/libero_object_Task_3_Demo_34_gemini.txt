## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle and place it in a basket.  The environment contained a basket on the floor, and several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and chocolate pudding) near the basket.  The bottles were located on either the floor or a nearby table.  The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce bottle, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket and release it.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to position itself close enough to the BBQ sauce bottle to be able to grasp it.  This involved moving forward, adjusting slightly to the right, and continuing forward to reach the appropriate location.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-9) The robot moved down to reach the bottle, closed its gripper to secure its hold.  The backward movements are potentially due to fine adjustments made to achieve optimal grasping.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-15) The robot lifted the BBQ sauce bottle, moved to the left, and then slightly down towards the basket's location. This sequence positions the bottle above the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket and Depart:** (Steps 16-19)  The robot moved down to place the bottle inside the basket, opened its gripper to release it, moved up, and finally stopped.
