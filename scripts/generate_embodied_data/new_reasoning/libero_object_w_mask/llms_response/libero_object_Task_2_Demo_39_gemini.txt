## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The robot operated in an environment containing a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, alphabet soup, milk, cream cheese, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing was located near the basket and the cream cheese.  The ketchup was near the salad dressing and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** This involves navigating to a position where the robot's gripper can reach the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** This involves lowering the gripper, closing it around the bottle, and lifting the bottle. (Steps 4-8)
3. **Move to the basket:** This involves moving the salad dressing to a position above the basket. (Steps 9-12)
4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** This involves lowering the salad dressing into the basket and opening the gripper to release it. (Steps 13-17)
