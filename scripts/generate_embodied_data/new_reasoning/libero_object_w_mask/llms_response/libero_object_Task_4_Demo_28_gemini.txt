## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a location on a surface and place it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle is assumed to be within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is also assumed to be within reach.  The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and place it in the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4.  This movement involves positioning the robot arm close enough to the ketchup to grasp it. This is necessary because the robot must be in the correct position to interact with the ketchup.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6. This movement involves closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle to securely hold it.  This is a crucial step for successfully picking up the ketchup.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-8.  This involves lifting the grasped ketchup bottle to a safe height.  This is crucial to avoid knocking over the bottle or the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-11. This movement involves transporting the ketchup to the basket. This is essential to complete the "place in basket" part of the task.


5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 11-13. This movement involves releasing the ketchup into the basket.  This marks the end of the pick-and-place task.


6. **Return to Initial Position:** Steps 14-15. This is a optional step that could return the arm to a home position.
