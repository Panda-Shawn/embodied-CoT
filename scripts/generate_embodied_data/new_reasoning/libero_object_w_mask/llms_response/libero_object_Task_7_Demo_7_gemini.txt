## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The milk carton was initially located to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly below the final position of the milk carton. The robot arm needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 1-6. The robot needed to move its arm to the correct position above the milk carton to prepare for grasping.  This involved navigating around obstacles (implicitly implied by the movement) and positioning itself for a secure grip.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 6-7.  The robot closes its gripper to secure the milk carton.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 8-11. The robot lifted the milk carton clear of the surface.  This required upward movement and a slight tilt to ensure a stable grasp.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-14.  The robot moved the milk carton horizontally towards the basket’s approximate location.

5. **Lower Milk Carton into Basket:** Steps 14-16. The robot lowered the milk carton towards the basket, ensuring proper placement.

6. **Release Milk Carton:** Steps 15-17. The robot opened its gripper to release the milk carton into the basket.
