## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was initially positioned to the right and slightly lower than the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly lower than the milk carton's position. The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, and then move to the basket, placing the milk carton inside before stopping.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-6. The robot needed to move to a position above the milk carton to grasp it.
2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 3-6. The robot needed to close its gripper around the milk carton.
3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 7-9. The robot needed to lift the milk carton from the surface.
4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-12. The robot needed to move to a position above the basket.
5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 12-17. The robot needed to adjust its position to accurately place the milk carton in the basket.
6. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 14-18. The robot needed to release the milk carton into the basket.
7. **Return and Stop:** Steps 18-19. The robot needed to move to a safe position and stop.
