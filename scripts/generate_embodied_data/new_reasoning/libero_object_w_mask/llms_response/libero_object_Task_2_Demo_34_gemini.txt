## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered table and placing it in a basket. The environment contained a wooden surface with several objects: salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce.  The salad dressing was initially on the table, and the basket was also on the table (implied, as the robot successfully places the salad dressing in it). The other objects were scattered around. The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing bottle, and the intended outcome was to successfully transfer it from its initial location to the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the salad dressing bottle.  This involved moving towards the correct area of the table to reach the bottle.

2. **Pick up Salad Dressing:** (Steps 4-5)  The robot needed to grasp the salad dressing bottle using its gripper.

3. **Lift and move to Basket:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifted the grasped bottle and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 9-13) The robot positioned the bottle above the basket and released it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14) The robot moved away from the basket.
