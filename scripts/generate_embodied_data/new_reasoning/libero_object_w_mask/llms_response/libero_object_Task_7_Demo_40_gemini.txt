1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of milk from a surface and place it in a basket.  The milk carton is assumed to be on a surface to the robot's right and slightly in front. The basket is assumed to be to the robot's left and slightly behind. The robot needs to approach the milk, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

* **Approach Milk:** Steps 1-3. The robot moves to a position where it can reach the milk carton.  This is necessary to get close enough to manipulate the milk.
* **Grasp Milk:** Steps 4-8. The robot lowers its arm, orients itself to grip the milk, and closes the gripper. This is crucial to secure the milk for transport.
* **Lift and Transport Milk:** Steps 9-12. The robot lifts the milk and moves it to the basket area.  This is required to move the milk to its destination.
* **Place Milk in Basket:** Steps 13-16. The robot orients itself, lowers the milk into the basket, and releases the grip.  This places the milk in the correct location.
