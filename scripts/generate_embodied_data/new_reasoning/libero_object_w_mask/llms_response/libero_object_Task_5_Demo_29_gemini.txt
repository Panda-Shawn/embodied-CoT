## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from its location on a surface and placing it into a basket. The sauce bottle was likely situated on a surface somewhat to the right and possibly slightly forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was presumably located further away from the robot's starting point, possibly to the left, and at a slightly higher elevation.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:**  (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the sauce bottle. This involved maneuvering around potential obstacles and positioning itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 5-7)  Once positioned, the robot had to extend its arm and close its gripper to securely hold the sauce bottle.

3. **Lift the tomato sauce:** (Steps 8-14) After grasping the bottle, the robot lifted it up, ensuring it maintained a stable grip while avoiding tilting or dropping the bottle.


4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 15-17)  The robot then moved to the location of the basket, carefully maneuvering around potential obstructions and maintaining a stable grip on the sauce bottle throughout the translation.

5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 18-23) Finally, the robot positioned the bottle over the basket, opened its gripper to release the bottle and then moved away.
