1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The environment included a wooden surface with several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, chocolate pudding, alphabet soup, and cream cheese) scattered around, and a basket. The BBQ sauce's initial location is not explicitly stated but inferred from the trajectory to be near the robot's starting position, potentially slightly below the level of the basket.  The basket is presumably on the wooden surface.  The general sequence of high-level movements was: approach the BBQ sauce, pick up the BBQ sauce, move to the basket, and place the BBQ sauce in the basket.

High-Level Movements:

* **Approach BBQ sauce:** Steps 0-4. This was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the BBQ sauce to grasp it.
* **Pick up BBQ sauce:** Steps 5-8. This involved moving the gripper down to the sauce and closing it.
* **Move to basket:** Steps 9-12. This movement relocated the sauce from its initial position to a position above the basket.
* **Place BBQ sauce in basket:** Steps 13-17. This involved lowering the arm, opening the gripper to release the sauce, and then retracting the arm.
