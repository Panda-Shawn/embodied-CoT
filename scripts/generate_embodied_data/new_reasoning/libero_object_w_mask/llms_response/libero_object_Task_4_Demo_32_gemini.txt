## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was situated to the right and somewhat forward of the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left of the ketchup bottle.  The high-level movements likely followed by the robot were:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** This involved navigating the robot to a position directly above the ketchup bottle.  This spans steps 1-5 in the trajectory. The robot needed to approach the ketchup before it could grasp it.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** This involved closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle. This is step 6 in the trajectory. This is necessary to pick up the ketchup.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** This involved lifting the ketchup bottle. This spans steps 8-10 in the trajectory.  The robot needed to lift the ketchup after grasping it to move it.

4. **Move to Basket:** This involved moving the ketchup bottle to a position above the basket. This spans steps 11-12 in the trajectory.  This step is crucial for placing the ketchup into the basket.

5. **Place Ketchup:** This involved placing the ketchup into the basket. This spans steps 13-15 in the trajectory. The robot needs to release the ketchup into the basket.
