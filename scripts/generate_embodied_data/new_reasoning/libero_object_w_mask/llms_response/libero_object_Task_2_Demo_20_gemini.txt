## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket located nearby.  The environment consisted of a wooden floor/table area with a basket centrally located.  Surrounding the basket were various items: salad dressing and ketchup bottles close to the basket; milk and cream cheese near the salad dressing; and alphabet soup and tomato sauce near the milk. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the salad dressing bottle into the basket.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to a position directly above the salad dressing bottle. This involved maneuvering through the cluttered space to avoid collisions.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 4-6) Once positioned, the robot needed to grasp the bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-9)  After grasping, the robot needed to lift the bottle vertically, clear of the surrounding objects.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-13) The robot had to move the salad dressing to a position directly above the basket. This might involve sideways and downward movements to account for the position of the basket.

5. **Place Salad Dressing:** (Steps 14-16) The robot needed to carefully lower the bottle into the basket and release its grip.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-20) The robot needed to move away from the basket, completing the task.
