## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from the floor and placing it in a basket, also located on the floor. The butter and basket were positioned such that the robot needed to navigate around to reach them. The robot's primary activity was manipulation and transportation. The intended outcome was to successfully transfer the butter from its initial location to the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:**  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position where it could grasp the butter. (Steps 1-6)
2. **Grasp the butter:** This involved closing the gripper around the butter. (Steps 7-8)
3. **Lift the butter:** This involved raising the arm to lift the butter from the floor. (Steps 10-11)
4. **Move to the basket:** This involved moving the butter to a position above the basket. (Steps 11-13)
5. **Lower the butter:** This involved lowering the butter into the basket. (Steps 13-15)
6. **Release the butter:** This involved opening the gripper to release the butter into the basket. (Steps 15-17)
7. **Retreat:**  This involved moving the arm away from the basket. (Steps 17-18)
