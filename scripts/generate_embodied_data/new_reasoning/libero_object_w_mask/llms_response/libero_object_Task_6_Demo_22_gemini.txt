## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from its initial location to the basket. The objects involved were the butter and the basket, both positioned on the floor.  The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position directly above the butter to allow for grasping. This involved moving towards the target location.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 5-6) The robot had to grasp the butter using its gripper. This required precise positioning and activation of the gripper.

3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 7-9) Once grasped, the butter had to be lifted off the floor to allow for transport to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-12)  The robot needed to move the butter to the location of the basket. This would involve moving horizontally to reach the basket's position.

5. **Place Butter:** (Steps 13-17)  Finally, the robot had to release the butter into the basket. This involved precisely positioning the butter above the basket and then opening the gripper to release the butter.
