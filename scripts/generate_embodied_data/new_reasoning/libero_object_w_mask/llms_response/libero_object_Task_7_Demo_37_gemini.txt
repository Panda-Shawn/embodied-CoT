## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  Both the milk carton and the basket were present in the robot's workspace.  The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it securely, lift it, and then transport it to the basket before releasing it.  The high-level movements were:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** (Steps 1-4) This involved moving the robotic arm into position to grasp the milk carton.  The robot needed to navigate around any potential obstacles. This positioning is crucial for successful grasping.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** (Steps 4-5) This involved closing the gripper around the milk carton. The gripper needed to be precisely positioned before closing to ensure a secure grasp.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot lifted the milk carton after successfully grasping it. This upward movement is necessary to clear the carton from the surface.

4. **Transport Milk Carton:** (Steps 8-11) The robot moved the milk carton towards the basket.  Precise movement was necessary to avoid collision with obstacles, maintaining balance while carrying the milk.

5. **Place Milk Carton:** (Steps 11-13) The robot positioned the milk carton above the basket and released it by opening the gripper. Accurate positioning ensures the milk carton lands within the basket without dropping.
