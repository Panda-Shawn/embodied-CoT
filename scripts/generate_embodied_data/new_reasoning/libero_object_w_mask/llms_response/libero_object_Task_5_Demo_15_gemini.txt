## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was initially located some distance from the robot and the basket. The basket was positioned to the left of the sauce bottle's location.  The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** (Steps 0-3)  This involved moving the robot arm forward towards the general vicinity of the tomato sauce bottle.

2. **Position above the tomato sauce:** (Steps 4-8)  This phase focused on positioning the gripper directly above the sauce bottle, preparing for grasping. This included downward movement and gripper closure.

3. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 6-8) This involved closing the gripper around the sauce bottle.

4. **Lift the tomato sauce:** (Steps 9-11) This involved lifting the grasped sauce bottle.

5. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 12-14) This involved moving the robot arm horizontally towards the basket.

6. **Position above the basket:** (Steps 14-17) This involved positioning the sauce bottle above the basket.

7. **Release the tomato sauce:** (Steps 15-18) This involved opening the gripper to release the sauce bottle into the basket.

8. **Return to home position:** (Steps 19-21) This involved moving back to a default position after task completion.
