### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a white wicker basket, also situated on the floor.  The butter and basket were positioned next to each other.  Other objects were present on the floor and a table, but irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:**  (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to maneuver its arm into a position to grasp the butter.  This involved positioning itself appropriately relative to the butter and basket.

2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 6-7)  The robot needed to close its gripper around the butter, securely holding it.

3. **Lift the butter:** (Steps 9-10)  The robot needed to lift the butter off the floor to avoid dragging it across the surface.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 10-12) The robot needed to move the butter towards the basket.

5. **Position over the basket:** (Steps 12-13) The robot needed to carefully position the butter directly above the basket.

6. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 14-16) The robot needed to release the butter into the basket.

7. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-18) The robot needed to move its arm away from the basket.
