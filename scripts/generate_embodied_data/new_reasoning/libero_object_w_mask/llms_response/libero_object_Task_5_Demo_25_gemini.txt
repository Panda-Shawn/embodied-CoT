## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and place it in a basket.  The tomato sauce is assumed to be situated on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is at a different location also within reach. The robot needs to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach the Tomato Sauce:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position above the tomato sauce bottle. This spans steps 0-4.  This is necessary to get the arm into a position to pick up the sauce bottle.

2. **Grasp the Tomato Sauce:** This involves lowering the arm and closing the gripper to secure the sauce bottle. This spans steps 5-7.  This is the critical step of acquiring the target object.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** This involves lifting the sauce bottle, moving it horizontally and vertically to the basket's location.  This spans steps 8-11. This movement is required to transport the bottle to its destination.

4. **Place the Tomato Sauce in the Basket:** This involves positioning the bottle above the basket and opening the gripper to release it.  This spans steps 12-14.  This action completes the task objective.

5. **Retreat:** This involves moving the arm away from the basket. This spans steps 15-17. This is a safety measure to avoid accidental collisions or interference.
