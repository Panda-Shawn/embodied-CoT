## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and place it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contains, besides the butter and basket, several other items: bottles of sauce (bbq sauce and ketchup next to each other), a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding. All these items are on the floor. The robot needs to navigate this cluttered space to reach the butter, grasp it carefully, lift it, and then transport it to the basket without disturbing the other items.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself close enough to the butter to grasp it without colliding with other objects.
2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 5-9) The robot needs to adjust its orientation to grasp the butter and close its gripper to secure the object.
3. **Lift the butter:** (Steps 10-13)  The robot lifts the butter, carefully avoiding obstacles, ensuring a secure grip.
4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 14-16) The robot navigates to the location of the basket.
5. **Place the butter:** (Steps 17-20) The robot positions itself above the basket, opens its gripper, and releases the butter into the basket.
