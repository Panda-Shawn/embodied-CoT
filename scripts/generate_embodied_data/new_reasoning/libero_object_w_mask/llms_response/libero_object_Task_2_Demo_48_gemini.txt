1. **Task Description and High-Level Movements**

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from an unspecified location on a table or floor and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several other condiment bottles (ketchup, tomato sauce, etc.) and possibly other items (alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk), creating a cluttered scene. The salad dressing’s initial position is unknown, but it was not initially in the basket.  The basket's location is also unspecified.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Locate and approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 1-4).  This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the salad dressing.  The exact location was likely unknown at the start, requiring exploration and visual processing to locate the target object amidst other items.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 5-7).  Once located, the robot had to position its gripper correctly and grasp the salad dressing bottle.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 8-11).  The robot next had to navigate from the salad dressing’s location to the basket.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket and retract:** (Steps 12-15).  Finally, the robot needed to place the salad dressing into the basket and then retract its arm.
