## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the transference of the butter from its initial position to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the butter inside the basket.  The butter and the basket were both on the floor; their exact relative positions are not explicitly defined, but the trajectory implies the basket is somewhat to the left and possibly slightly forward of the butter.


The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Butter:** Steps 0-4. The robot needs to position itself appropriately above the butter to grasp it. This involves moving closer to the butter's location.

2. **Grasp Butter:** Steps 4-5. This involves the closing of the gripper to secure the butter.

3. **Lift Butter:** Steps 6-7. The robot needs to lift the butter from the floor to clear the ground.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-10.  The robot now moves the butter towards the basketâ€™s location.

5. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 10-11.  This phase involves precise positioning above the basket to facilitate butter placement.

6. **Release Butter:** Steps 11-13. The robot opens the gripper to release the butter into the basket.

7. **Retract:** Steps 13-15.  The robot moves away from the basket to avoid interference.
