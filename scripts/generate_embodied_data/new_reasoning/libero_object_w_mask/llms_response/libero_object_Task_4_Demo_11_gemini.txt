## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface, and the basket was positioned somewhere else in the robot's workspace. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, finally releasing it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move its arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing to grasp it. This involved maneuvering around any obstacles and positioning itself for a stable grip.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Step 5) The robot closed its gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifted the ketchup bottle from the surface, ensuring a secure hold during the lift.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot moved to a position above the basket.  This likely involved navigating potential obstacles and adjusting its arm's position for a successful placement.

5. **Place Ketchup:** (Steps 12-14) The robot opened its gripper to release the ketchup into the basket, completing the task.
