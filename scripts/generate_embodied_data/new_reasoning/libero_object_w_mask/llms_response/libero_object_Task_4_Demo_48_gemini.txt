## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the ketchup bottle from a surface containing several other condiment bottles and place it in a basket. The ketchup bottle, along with the bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk, were all situated on a wooden surface (floor or table).  The basket was also on this surface. The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the basket, and release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-3)  The robot needed to position itself close enough to the ketchup bottle to be able to grasp it.  This involved navigating around other objects on the surface.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 4-7) The robot needed to lower its gripper, approach the ketchup bottle, and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and Transport Ketchup:** (Steps 8-11) The robot needed to lift the ketchup bottle and move it to the basket's location.

4. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** (Steps 12-15) The robot needed to lower the ketchup bottle into the basket and release its grip.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 16-17) The robot moves away from the basket to signal task completion.
