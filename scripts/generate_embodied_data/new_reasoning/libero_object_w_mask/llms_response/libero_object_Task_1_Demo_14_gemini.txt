## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface, and the basket was situated at some distance and possibly at a different height. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it.

The trajectory suggests the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4. The robot moves towards the cream cheese, positioning itself for grasping.  This is necessary because the robot initially starts at a distance from the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. The robot lowers its gripper and closes it around the cream cheese. This is essential for picking up the cream cheese.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-12. The robot lifts the cream cheese and moves towards the basket. This is necessary to move the cream cheese from its initial position to the basket.

4. **Position over Basket:** Steps 12-14. The robot positions itself directly above the basket. This action ensures the cream cheese is released into the basket accurately.

5. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-21. The robot lowers itself, opens its gripper releasing the cream cheese into the basket. This is the final step to complete the task successfully.
