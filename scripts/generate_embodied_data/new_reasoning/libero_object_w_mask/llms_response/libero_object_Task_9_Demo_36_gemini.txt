## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a bottle of orange juice from a surface and place it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, presumably a table, within the robot's reachable workspace. The basket was also within reach, at a different location. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it carefully without damaging it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and carefully place the juice bottle inside the basket.  The general sequence involved approaching the orange juice, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, and releasing it into the basket.

The robot's likely high-level movements were:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 1-4. The robot needed to move itself to a position close enough to reach the orange juice bottle.  The multiple "move forward" commands indicate a process of getting closer to the target.
2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 5-7. This involved moving down to reach the orange juice and closing the gripper to secure the bottle.
3. **Lift Orange Juice:** Steps 9-10. The robot had to lift the bottle after grasping it to clear it from the table.
4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-14. The robot moved from the location of the orange juice to the basket, likely involving adjustments in both lateral and vertical directions.
5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 15-16.  The robot positioned the orange juice bottle over the basket and opened the gripper to release it.
