## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese and place it in a basket.  We assume the cream cheese is located on a surface, and the basket is nearby but not directly adjacent. The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, releasing it inside.

The high-level movements the robot likely executed are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to initially position itself close enough to the cream cheese to be able to grasp it.  This involves moving forward and downwards towards the object.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 3-5) This involves positioning the gripper directly above the cream cheese, moving down towards it, and then closing the gripper to secure the object.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** (Steps 6-8) After grasping, the robot needs to lift the cream cheese upwards, to clear the surface it rests on.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 9-11) Next, the robot has to move the cream cheese, now held in its gripper, to the location of the basket. This might involve a sideways movement.

5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** (Steps 12-15)  Finally, the robot needs to position the cream cheese above the basket, open the gripper to release it, and then move away slightly, ensuring the cheese is placed successfully in the basket.
