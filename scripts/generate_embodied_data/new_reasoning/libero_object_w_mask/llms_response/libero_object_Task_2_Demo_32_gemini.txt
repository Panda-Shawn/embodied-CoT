## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered environment and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained several other items: ketchup and the target salad dressing near the basket on the floor; milk and cream cheese on a table; and alphabet soup and tomato sauce also on the floor. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the salad dressing from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-2)  This was necessary to position the robotic arm within reach of the salad dressing bottle.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 3-5) This involved moving the arm downwards, and closing the gripper around the bottle.

3. **Lift the salad dressing:** (Steps 6-8) This moved the bottle upward, clearing it from the surface where it was resting.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 8-10) This repositioned the bottle above the basket.

5. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 10-13) This involved lowering the bottle into the basket and releasing the gripper.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-17) This was for safe retraction after completing the task.
