## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other objects: ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing and ketchup were positioned near the basket. The alphabet soup was next to the cream cheese, and the tomato sauce was next to the milk. The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing bottle, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 1-7. The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing bottle, avoiding obstacles and positioning itself for grasping.
2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** Steps 7-8. The robot needed to accurately grasp the salad dressing bottle with its gripper.
3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 9-11.  The robot needed to lift the grasped bottle and move it towards the basket.
4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** Steps 12-15. The robot needed to precisely position the bottle in the basket and release it.
