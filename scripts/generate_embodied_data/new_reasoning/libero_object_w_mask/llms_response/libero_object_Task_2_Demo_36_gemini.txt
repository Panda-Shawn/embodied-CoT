## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it in a white basket.  The salad dressing bottle was located next to the basket on what appears to be a floor or table.  The basket was on the floor. Other items present in the environment included a ketchup bottle, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce, all situated near the basket and each other.  The robot needed to navigate around these objects to reach the salad dressing and then deposit it into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to pick up the salad dressing bottle. This involved navigating around other objects on the table to reach the desired location.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-6)  This involved moving the robotic arm downwards until the gripper could grasp the bottle, followed by closing the gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 7-11) Once the salad dressing was secured, the robot had to move to the location of the basket to place the bottle inside.  This involved moving upwards and then navigating to a position above the basket.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 12-14)  Finally, the robot positioned itself above the basket to release the salad dressing bottle, followed by opening the gripper to release it and complete the task.

5. **Stop:** (Step 15) The task is complete.
