## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was positioned at a different location. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and carefully place it inside.  The high-level movements likely followed this general sequence:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 1-9) The robot needed to position itself appropriately above the cream cheese container to prepare for grasping. This involved maneuvering around any obstacles and getting the gripper close enough to the cream cheese.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 8-9) The robot needed to close its gripper around the container of cream cheese to secure a grip.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** (Steps 11-15)  The robot needed to lift the cream cheese from the surface, elevate it to a safe transport height, and move it towards the basket. This involved upward movement and careful navigation to avoid collisions.

4. **Position above Basket:** (Steps 16-20) The robot needed to maneuver itself above the basket to prepare to place the cream cheese inside it.  This likely involved some adjustments in orientation and height to align with the basket.

5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** (Steps 17-26) The robot needed to open the gripper and carefully deposit the cream cheese container into the basket. This involved adjusting position, controlling the release of the gripper, and perhaps tilting to ensure smooth placement.
