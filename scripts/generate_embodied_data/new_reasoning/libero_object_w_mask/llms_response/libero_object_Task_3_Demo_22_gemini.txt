## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it into a basket.  The environment contained a wooden surface with several condiment bottles (BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing) and other items (chocolate pudding, alphabet soup, cream cheese) scattered around.  The BBQ sauce bottle, specifically, was initially located on the table, possibly near other items.  The basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and carefully transport it to the basket, placing it inside.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to initially position itself for optimal access to the BBQ sauce bottle.  This involved navigating around other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8) Once correctly positioned, the robot needed to grip the BBQ sauce bottle securely.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 9-12)  After grasping the bottle, the robot lifted it and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot needed to carefully release the bottle into the basket.

5. **Return to Rest Position:** (Steps 17-19)  The robot concluded the task by returning to a safe and neutral resting position.
