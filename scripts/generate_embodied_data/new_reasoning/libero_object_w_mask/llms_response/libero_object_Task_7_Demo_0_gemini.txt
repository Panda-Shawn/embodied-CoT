## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a milk carton from a location and place it in a basket.  We assume the milk carton is positioned to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position, and the basket is to the left and below the robot's final position. The robot's gripper is initially open.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the milk carton, grasping the milk carton, lifting the milk carton, moving the milk carton to the basket, and placing the milk carton in the basket.

The identified high-level movements are:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** Steps 0-3.  This movement is necessary to position the robot's gripper over the milk carton before attempting to grasp it.  The robot needs to move to a location above the milk carton to prepare for grasping.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** Steps 3-6.  This is crucial to secure the milk carton for subsequent movements. Closing the gripper around the milk carton is essential before lifting.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Steps 6-8.  This movement raises the milk carton above the surface to allow for unobstructed movement towards the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-11.  This movement transports the milk carton from its initial location to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** Steps 11-14.  This involves lowering the milk carton into the basket and releasing the grip.
