## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it into a basket.  The cream cheese is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket is situated at a different location also within reach.  The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket, finally releasing it into the basket.


The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-5. This involves moving the robot arm towards the cream cheese, adjusting its position to be directly above the cream cheese.  This is necessary to position the gripper optimally for grasping.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-8. This involves lowering the gripper, closing it around the cream cheese to secure its grip. This is a crucial step for successfully completing the task.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 9-13. This phase lifts the cream cheese from the surface and prepares for movement to the basket. Lifting is necessary to avoid dragging the cream cheese along the surface. The tilting down of the arm helps with stability during the lift.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 14-16. This phase involves moving the cream cheese to the basket, requiring appropriate positional adjustments. The basket location isn't specified as directly above the arm, necessitating this step.

5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 17-19. This final phase involves lowering the cream cheese into the basket and releasing it.  Opening the gripper releases the cream cheese, achieving the final task goal.
