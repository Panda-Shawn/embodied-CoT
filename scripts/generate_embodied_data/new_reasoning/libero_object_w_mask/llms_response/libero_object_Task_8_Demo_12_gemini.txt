## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a chocolate pudding from a basket and placing it back into the same basket.  The environment contained a basket on the floor, a chocolate pudding inside the basket, and several other food items (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) positioned around the basket. The pudding was initially located within the basket along with alphabet soup.  The robot needed to pick up the pudding, and then place it back down in the same basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Pick Up Pudding:** Steps 1-4.  This involved moving to the pudding’s location and grasping it.  The pudding was already inside the basket, so the robot only needed to position itself correctly.

2. **Lift Pudding:** Steps 6-7.  This involved raising the pudding to clear any obstacles before moving it.

3. **Move Pudding (Slight Adjustment):** Steps 8-10. This seems to be the robot adjusting the pudding’s position possibly to account for any slight misalignment, to ensure it can be placed back down correctly and securely.

4. **Place Pudding Back Down:** Steps 11-14. This involved lowering and releasing the pudding back into the basket.
