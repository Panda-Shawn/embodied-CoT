## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it in a basket located on the same floor. The environment contained several other bottles (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered around the floor, none of which were directly interacting with each other or the target pudding or basket. The basket was positioned on the floor, and the chocolate pudding was also situated on the floor amongst the other bottles.  The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve the goal involved:  approaching the chocolate pudding, grasping the pudding, lifting the pudding, moving to the basket, placing the pudding into the basket, and finally, returning to a resting position.


Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** Steps 1-5.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the chocolate pudding to grasp it. The robot needed to navigate around other objects on the floor to reach the target.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** Steps 6-8. This movement involved maneuvering the gripper to the pudding and closing it to secure a grip.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** Steps 10-11. This movement raised the pudding from the floor to a safe height, clearing the floor and avoiding collisions.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-15.  This movement involved navigating the robot arm towards the basket while holding the chocolate pudding.

5. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** Steps 16-18. This movement involved opening the gripper to release the pudding into the basket.

6. **Return to Resting Position:** Steps 18-19. This movement returned the robot arm to its initial or a safe resting position after completing the task.
