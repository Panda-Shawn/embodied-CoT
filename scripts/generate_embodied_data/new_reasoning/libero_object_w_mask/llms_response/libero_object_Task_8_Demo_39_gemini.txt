## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a chocolate pudding from a basket and placing it back into the same basket.  The environment contained a basket on the floor, a chocolate pudding inside the basket, along with other items (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) positioned around the basket. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the chocolate pudding remaining in the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the basket:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the basket.  (Steps 1-3)
2. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved moving the arm down to grasp the pudding and close the gripper. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the chocolate pudding:** This involved moving the arm upward with the grasped pudding. (Steps 7-8)
4. **Move slightly to the side (optional):** To create better positioning for placement (Step 9)
5. **Place the chocolate pudding back in the basket:** This involved moving the arm downward, opening the gripper to release the pudding into the basket. (Steps 10-14)
6. **Retreat:** The arm moves slightly up and then stops (Steps 15-16)
