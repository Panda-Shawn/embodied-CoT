1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving the salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it in a nearby wicker basket.  The environment included a wooden floor, a white wicker basket, salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing and ketchup were located near the basket on the table, along with the other items. The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing, grasp it without disturbing other objects, lift it, move it to the basket, and carefully place it inside.  The general sequence involved approaching the salad dressing, picking it up, moving it to the basket, and releasing it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 1-6. This involved navigating to a position above the salad dressing, preparing for grasping.
2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** Steps 5-6. This included precise maneuvering and gripper closure to securely pick up the dressing.
3. **Lift and Transport to Basket:** Steps 8-13. This involved lifting the salad dressing, navigating around any obstacles, and moving towards the basket.
4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** Steps 14-17. This entailed positioning the salad dressing above the basket and releasing it.
5. **Post-Placement Adjustment:** Steps 18-19. This likely involved a minor adjustment for proper placement.
