## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface, while the basket was in a different location, possibly at a higher elevation. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, carefully releasing it.


The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3.  The robot needed to move towards the cream cheese to be within reach of its gripper. This involved positioning itself appropriately for grasping.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 3-4.  Once positioned, the robot had to close its gripper to secure the cream cheese.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-7. After grasping, the robot needed to lift the cream cheese and navigate past any obstacles towards the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-9. The robot needed to move towards the location of the basket.

5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 9-12. The robot positioned itself to deposit the cream cheese into the basket, then opened the gripper to release it.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 12-13. The robot moved away from the basket, completing the task.
