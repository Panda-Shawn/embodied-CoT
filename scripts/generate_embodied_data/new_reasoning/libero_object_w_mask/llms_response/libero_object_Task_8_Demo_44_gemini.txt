1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from the table and placing it into a basket.  The chocolate pudding was located on a wooden surface or table amongst other objects: orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate to the pudding, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the basket, and finally deposit it within the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 1-6)  This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the chocolate pudding, positioning the gripper for grasping.  This was necessary to get the robot arm close enough to the pudding to interact with it.

2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 6-7)  This involved closing the gripper around the pudding, securely holding it.  This step was crucial for successful manipulation of the pudding.

3. **Lift and Transport the Chocolate Pudding to the Basket:** (Steps 8-11) This involved lifting the pudding and moving it to the basketâ€™s location. This was required to move the pudding from its initial location to its target location.

4. **Place the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** (Steps 12-16) This involved positioning the pudding above the basket and releasing it. This was the final step in completing the task.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 17-19) The robot moved away slightly to ensure no contact was maintained with the pudding or the basket.
