## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket.  The environment included a wooden surface (floor or table) with several other condiment bottles (ketchup, salad dressing, etc.), a basket, and possibly other items (alphabet soup, cream cheese).  The initial location of the BBQ sauce is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory implies it was not already in the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:  approaching the BBQ sauce, picking it up, and then moving to and placing it in the basket.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** Steps 0-6. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the BBQ sauce to grasp it.  The robot needed to navigate around other objects on the table to reach its target.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 6-7.  This involved using the gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-12. This phase involved navigating from the BBQ sauce location to the basket.  This likely required avoiding obstacles and adjusting the arm's position to prepare for placement.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 12-16. This involved releasing the BBQ sauce gently into the basket.
