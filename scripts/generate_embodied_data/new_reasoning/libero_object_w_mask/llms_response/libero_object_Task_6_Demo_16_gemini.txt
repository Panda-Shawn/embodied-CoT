## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the floor to the basket. The objects involved were the butter and the basket, both on the floor at different positions. The general sequence of high-level movements comprised:

1. **Approaching the butter:** The robot needed to move itself into a position where it could reach the butter.
2. **Picking up the butter:** This involved positioning the gripper above the butter, closing the gripper to secure the butter, and then lifting the butter slightly from the floor.
3. **Moving to the basket:** After picking up the butter, the robot had to transport it to the basket.
4. **Placing the butter in the basket:**  This involved positioning the butter above the basket and opening the gripper to release it.

**High-Level Movements Breakdown:**

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approaching the butter | 0-6 | The robot needs to position itself close enough to the butter to pick it up.  The movements suggest a path from a distance to a point above and near the butter. |
| Picking up the butter | 7-10 | This phase involves getting the gripper in the correct orientation and then closing the gripper to secure the butter. |
| Moving to the basket | 12-16 | The robot now transports the grasped butter to the basket's proximity. |
| Placing the butter in the basket | 17-20 |  The robot positions the butter over the basket and then opens the gripper to release the butter. |
