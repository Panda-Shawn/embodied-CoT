## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up the chocolate pudding from a table or floor and placing it into a basket.  The pudding was initially located on a surface alongside other items: orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The basket was also on the same surface. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and gripping to avoid contact with other objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the chocolate pudding from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Pudding:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the chocolate pudding, positioning itself for the pickup. This involved moving and orienting appropriately to ensure a successful grasp.

2. **Grasp Pudding:** (Steps 3-5) Once positioned, the robot had to lower its gripper and carefully grasp the pudding. The robot had to execute a grasping motion and ensure a secure grip to prevent dropping the pudding.

3. **Lift Pudding:** (Steps 6-7)  After successfully grasping the pudding, the robot needed to lift it from the table. This involved a vertical movement to clear the pudding from the table surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-10) The robot then needed to move to the target location: the basket. It had to move the pudding to the basket carefully, avoiding collisions with the other objects on the table.

5. **Place Pudding:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needed to carefully position the pudding above the basket and release its grip. This stage required precise positioning to ensure the pudding landed inside the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-16) After placing the pudding, the robot retracted to its starting position. This was done to ensure there were no accidental collisions or further disruptions to the environment.
