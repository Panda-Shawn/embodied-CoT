## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, and a basket positioned on the floor. The objects were not initially interacting with each other. The robot needed to navigate to the chocolate pudding, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, carefully placing it inside.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move into a position to reach the chocolate pudding bottle. This involved maneuvering around other objects on the floor.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 5-6)  The robot needed to accurately position its gripper over the chocolate pudding and secure a grasp.

3. **Lift Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 7-10)  The robot needed to lift the chocolate pudding bottle from the floor, ensuring a secure hold during the lifting process.  This involves tilting to maintain grip.

4. **Transport to Basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot needed to navigate to the basket while carefully holding the chocolate pudding.  This involved moving around other obstacles to avoid collision.

5. **Place in Basket:** (Steps 15-18) The robot needed to place the chocolate pudding in the basket. This involved carefully positioning the bottle and then releasing it.

6. **Return to Neutral Position:** (Steps 19) The robot returned to a default position after completing the task.
