## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was positioned to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was located to the left and slightly below the ketchup.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and deposit the ketchup into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move its arm to a position above and slightly in front of the ketchup bottle to prepare for grasping.  This involved maneuvering around potential obstacles and positioning itself for a successful grip.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 4-6) This involved closing the gripper around the ketchup bottle. Tilting the gripper upwards helped secure the grip.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 7-9) Once the bottle was grasped, the robot lifted it vertically.

4. **Move Ketchup to Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The robot moved the ketchup bottle toward the basket, maintaining its grasp.

5. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 12-13) The robot positioned the bottle directly above the basket.

6. **Release Ketchup:** (Steps 13-15) The robot opened the gripper, releasing the ketchup bottle into the basket.

7. **Return to Rest Position:** (Steps 16-19) Final movements to return the arm to a resting state.
