1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle from the table and place it in the basket.  The environment contained a table with several objects scattered on it: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The BBQ sauce bottle was initially located near other objects on the table. The basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and place it inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-6)  The robot moved to a position above the BBQ sauce bottle, preparing to grasp it. This involved navigating around other objects on the table.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-7) The robot lowered its gripper to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle, closing its gripper to secure its hold.

3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 8-10) The robot lifted the BBQ sauce bottle, ensuring a firm grip.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 11-18) The robot moved the BBQ sauce bottle from its original location to a position above the basket.  This involved navigating around obstacles on the table.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 19-24) The robot lowered the BBQ sauce bottle into the basket and released its grip.
