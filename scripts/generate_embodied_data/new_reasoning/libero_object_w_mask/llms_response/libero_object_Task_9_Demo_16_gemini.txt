## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle was presumably located within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at a different location, requiring movement of the arm. The general sequence of high-level movements appears to be:

1. **Approach the orange juice:** The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the orange juice bottle.
2. **Grasp the orange juice:** The robot needed to use its gripper to securely hold the orange juice bottle.
3. **Lift the orange juice:**  The robot needed to raise the orange juice bottle to a height that would clear any obstacles during transport.
4. **Move to the basket:** The robot needed to move the orange juice bottle to a position above the basket.
5. **Place the orange juice in the basket:** The robot needed to lower the orange juice bottle into the basket and release it.


High-Level Movement Breakdown:

* **Approach the orange juice:** Steps 1-6. This involved moving forward and downward to reach the bottle.
* **Grasp the orange juice:** Steps 7-10. This included moving down, backward, and closing the gripper to secure the bottle.
* **Lift the orange juice:** Steps 11-14. This involved moving upward and potentially adjusting the tilt to maintain a secure grip.
* **Move to the basket:** Steps 15-17. This included moving to the left and downward to reach the basket's location.
* **Place the orange juice in the basket:** Steps 18-20. This involved moving down, opening the gripper to release the bottle into the basket.
