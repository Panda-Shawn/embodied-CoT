## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a tomato sauce bottle from a surface and place it in a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was assumed to be on a surface in front of the robot, and the basket was located to the left and slightly higher than the bottle. The robot needed to navigate to the bottle, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket before releasing it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move towards the bottle to be within reach of its arm.
2. **Grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 5-10) The robot adjusted its orientation and gripper to securely grasp the bottle.
3. **Lift the tomato sauce:** (Steps 11-13) The robot lifted the bottle to clear the surface.
4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 14-22) The robot moved from the bottle's location towards the basketâ€™s position.
5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 23-27) The robot positioned the bottle above the basket and released it.
6. **Retreat:** (Steps 28) The robot moved back slightly.
