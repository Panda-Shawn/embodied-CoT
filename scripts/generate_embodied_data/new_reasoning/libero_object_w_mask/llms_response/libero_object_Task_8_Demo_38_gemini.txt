## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the chocolate pudding and place it in the basket. The robot operates in an environment containing several objects on a surface: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The chocolate pudding and the basket are initially in separate locations. The robot needs to navigate to the chocolate pudding, grasp it, and then move it to the basket.  The general sequence involves:

1. **Approaching the Pudding:** The robot must move towards the chocolate pudding to a position suitable for grasping.
2. **Grasping the Pudding:** The robot needs to accurately position its gripper above the pudding and close its gripper to secure the pudding.
3. **Moving to the Basket:** The robot must move the grasped pudding to the basket's location.
4. **Placing the Pudding:** The robot has to precisely position the pudding in the basket and release it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach Chocolate Pudding   | 1-4        | To get close enough to the pudding for grasping.                               |
| Grasp Chocolate Pudding     | 4-6        | To pick up the pudding securely.                                                |
| Move to Basket              | 7-11       | To transport the pudding to its destination.                                      |
| Place Pudding in Basket      | 11-14      | To release the pudding into the basket.                                          |
