### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the chocolate pudding and place it in the basket.  The chocolate pudding, basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup were scattered on a wooden floor or table. The primary activity was manipulation: the robot needed to move the chocolate pudding from its initial location to the basket. The intended outcome was the chocolate pudding resting inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the chocolate pudding:** This involved navigating to the pudding's location.  (Steps 0-2)
2. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved positioning the gripper above the pudding and closing the gripper to grasp it. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the chocolate pudding:** This involved raising the arm to clear the table/floor surface. (Step 5)
4. **Move to the basket:** This involved moving the arm carrying the pudding towards the basket's location. (Steps 6-9)
5. **Place the chocolate pudding in the basket:** This involved lowering the arm into the basket and releasing the pudding. (Steps 10-11)
6. **Return to a neutral position:** This is likely a safety measure to ensure the robot finishes in a stable pose. (Steps 12-14)
