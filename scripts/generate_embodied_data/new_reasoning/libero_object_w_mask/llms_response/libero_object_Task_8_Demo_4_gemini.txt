## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a chocolate pudding from a basket and placing it back in the same basket.  The robot operated in an environment containing a basket and several other food items (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) all located on the floor. The chocolate pudding was initially inside the basket. The primary activity was the manipulation of the chocolate pudding; the intended outcome was the pudding's successful transfer from the basket, briefly outside the basket, and then back into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements would be: 1. Approach the basket; 2. Pick up the pudding; 3. Lift the pudding; 4. Place the pudding back in the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the Basket:** This spans steps 0-2.  The robot needs to position itself correctly to interact with the basket containing the pudding.

2. **Pick up the Pudding:** This spans steps 3-4. The robot needs to grasp the pudding within the basket.

3. **Lift the Pudding:** This spans steps 5-7. The robot must lift the pudding from inside the basket.  Note that Step 5 is a momentary pause for stability.


4. **Place Pudding back in Basket:** This spans steps 8-15.  The robot must position the pudding for placement and then release the pudding back into the basket.  Steps 11-12 and 13-14 represent intermediate steps related to opening the gripper and positioning the robot arm.  Step 15 is a final stabilization pause.
