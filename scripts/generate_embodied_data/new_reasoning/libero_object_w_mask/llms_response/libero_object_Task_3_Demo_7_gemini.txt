## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket. The environment included a wooden surface with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The initial location of the BBQ sauce bottle is not explicitly stated but implied to be on the surface near other items. The basket was also on the surface. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation with the intended outcome of having the BBQ sauce bottle safely inside the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** Steps 0-6. The robot needed to navigate to the location of the BBQ sauce bottle.  This involved positioning itself appropriately to grasp the bottle.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 5-6. The robot used its gripper to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-10. The robot lifted the BBQ sauce and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** Steps 11-16.  The robot carefully placed the BBQ sauce inside the basket, ensuring a stable placement.

5. **Retract:** Steps 17-18. The robot moved its arm away from the basket after successfully placing the BBQ sauce.
