1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contained a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, milk and cream cheese near the salad dressing, and a carton of alphabet soup near the milk. All items were situated on a wooden surface.  The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket, then release it.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the salad dressing, grasping the salad dressing, lifting the salad dressing, moving to the basket, placing the salad dressing in the basket, and finally, releasing the salad dressing.

High-Level Movements:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to position itself correctly to grasp the salad dressing bottle. This involved navigating around other objects to reach an optimal grasping position.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** Steps 5-6. The robot needed to acquire a firm grip on the salad dressing bottle to lift it successfully.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-11.  The robot needed to lift the salad dressing bottle and carefully transport it to the basket without dropping it or colliding with other objects.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** Steps 12-16. The robot needed to place the salad dressing into the basket and ensure it's stable and safely deposited.

5. **Release Salad Dressing:** Steps 16-17. The robot needed to open its gripper to release the salad dressing bottle.
