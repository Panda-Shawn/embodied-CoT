1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a tomato sauce bottle from a location on a surface and place it into a basket.  The tomato sauce is assumed to be located somewhat in front of the robot and slightly to its right. The basket is presumed to be to the robot's left. The robot must navigate to the sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, placing it inside.


The robot's plan likely involved these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-3. This involves moving closer to the sauce and orienting itself appropriately.

2. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 4-8. This involves moving the gripper down to the sauce, closing the gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Lift the tomato sauce:** Steps 10-11. This involves raising the bottle upwards.

4. **Move to the basket:** Steps 12-16. This involves traversing from the tomato sauce's position to the basket's location.

5. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 16-19. This involves positioning the bottle over the basket and then releasing it.
