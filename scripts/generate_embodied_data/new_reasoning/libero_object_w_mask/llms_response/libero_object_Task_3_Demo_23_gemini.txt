## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered environment and placing it in a basket. The environment consisted of a table or floor with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The BBQ sauce was initially located somewhere near other items, not in the basket, which itself was also situated on the surface.  The primary activity was to locate the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the BBQ sauce inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level movement plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to move itself into a position where it could reach the BBQ sauce. This involved navigating around potential obstacles.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-8) Once close enough, the robot needed to extend its arm towards the BBQ sauce and grip it securely.  Precise positioning and gripper manipulation were crucial at this stage.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 10-12) After gripping the BBQ sauce, the robot lifted it and moved it towards the basket. This required precise control of its arm to avoid dropping the sauce.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot needed to position itself over the basket accurately and carefully place the BBQ sauce inside.

5. **Depart:** (Steps 18-21) Once the BBQ sauce was placed into the basket, the robot withdrew its arm and moved to a safe stopping position.
