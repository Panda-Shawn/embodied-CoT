## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it into a basket, also situated on the floor. The primary activity was a two-phase manipulation: grasping the butter and then depositing it in the target location. The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (on the floor).  The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it securely, then navigate to the basket, and finally release the butter into the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to grasp the butter.  This involved moving towards the butter's location.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 4-6)  The robot had to close its gripper around the butter to secure a grip.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-16)  This involved lifting the butter, moving over to the basket's location, and possibly adjusting its orientation to prepare for placement.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 17-20) The robot had to open its gripper to release the butter into the basket.
