## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a container of cream cheese from within a basket and placing it back down. The robot operated in an environment containing a basket, cream cheese, and several other irrelevant items (alphabet soup, milk, tomato sauce, butter, and orange juice) on a table or floor. The cream cheese was initially located inside the basket. The goal was to pick up the cream cheese from within the basket and reposition it back onto the table near the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Basket (Steps 0-4):** The robot needed to navigate to a position near the basket to be able to reach the cream cheese within it. This involved moving forward and slightly adjusting its position to optimally align with the basket.

2. **Pick up the Cream Cheese (Steps 5-8):** Once close to the basket, the robot needed to grasp the cream cheese. This required maneuvering the arm downwards, and closing the gripper to secure the container.

3. **Lift and Move Away from Basket (Steps 9-11):** After grasping the cream cheese, the robot needed to lift it out of the basket and move away slightly to avoid interference during the next steps.

4. **Place Cream Cheese (Steps 12-16):** This stage involved carefully lowering the cream cheese near the basket, opening the gripper to release it and then stabilizing the arm.


5. **Return to Starting Position (Steps 17-26):**  The robot moved back to an initial resting position. This could have been a part of the programmed behavior or to prepare for a subsequent task.
