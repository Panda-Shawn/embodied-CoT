### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it into a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was situated some distance away, requiring the robot to navigate and reorient itself.  The robot's goal was to successfully transfer the orange juice from its initial location to the basket without spilling its contents.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-7)  The robot needed to move into a position where it could grasp the orange juice bottle. This involved navigating to the juice's location.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needed to pick up the orange juice bottle securely using its gripper.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-15) The robot needed to transport the orange juice bottle from its initial location to the basket without dropping it.  This involved navigating around any obstacles and positioning itself correctly above the basket.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 14-16) The robot needed to carefully place the orange juice bottle into the basket.
