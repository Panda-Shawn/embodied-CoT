## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a cream cheese container from a surface and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at some distance and possibly at a different height. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then carefully release it into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary would involve:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** The robot needed to move to a position where the cream cheese is within reach of its gripper. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** The robot had to lower its gripper, close it around the cream cheese, and ensure a secure grip. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** The robot needed to lift the cream cheese and move it to the basket's location. (Steps 8-20)
4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** The robot had to position the cream cheese above the basket, open its gripper to release it, and then move away. (Steps 21-25)
