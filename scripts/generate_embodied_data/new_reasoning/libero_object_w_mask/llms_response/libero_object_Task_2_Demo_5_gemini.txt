## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered countertop and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment included a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce cartons. The salad dressing and ketchup were close together, near the basket. The robot needed to navigate around other items to reach the salad dressing without disturbing them.  The general sequence involved approaching the salad dressing, picking it up, and then moving it to the basket.

Based on the trajectory, the high-level movements are:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 0-2. The robot needed to initially position itself for an optimal grasp of the salad dressing. This involved moving forward and slightly to the right to avoid obstacles, and then adjusting its position to be directly above the salad dressing.

2. **Pick Up Salad Dressing:** Steps 3-6.  The robot needed to lower itself, tilt slightly to align with the dressing's bottle shape, and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** Steps 7-9. The robot needed to lift the bottle, clear the obstacle, and start moving towards the basket.

4. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 10-12. The robot needed to move to the appropriate location above the basket to drop the salad dressing.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** Steps 13-15. The robot needed to lower the dressing into the basket and release its grip.
