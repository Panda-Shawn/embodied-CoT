## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained the butter, a basket, bottles of bbq sauce, ketchup, orange juice, and chocolate pudding, and a can of tomato sauce.  All items were on the floor. The bbq sauce bottle was positioned next to the ketchup bottle. The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the butter:** (Steps 0-3)  This involved navigating the cluttered floor to reach a position directly above the butter.  This was necessary to avoid collisions and ensure accurate grasping.

2. **Grasp the butter:** (Steps 4-7) This involved precise positioning of the robotic arm above the butter and closing the gripper to securely hold it.

3. **Lift and move the butter to the basket:** (Steps 8-11) This involved lifting the butter and moving towards the basket's location.  This was needed to clear the space between the butter's initial position and its destination.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 12-16) This involved precise positioning of the arm above the basket and opening the gripper to release the butter.
