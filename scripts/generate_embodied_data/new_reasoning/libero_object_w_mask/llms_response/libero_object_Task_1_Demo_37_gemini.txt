## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of cream cheese from a surface and place it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within the robot's reachable workspace, while the basket was situated at a different location, also within reach. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** (Steps 0-5)  The robot needed to move to a position directly above the cream cheese, adjusting its orientation to be ready for grasping. This involved navigating obstacles (implied by the varied movements) and positioning itself optimally for the grasp.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** (Steps 6-7) The robot had to close its gripper to secure the cream cheese.

3. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese:** (Steps 8-10) The robot lifted the cream cheese and moved it towards the basket.

4. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 11-12) The robot needed to position itself above the basket to accurately drop off the cream cheese.

5. **Release Cream Cheese:** (Steps 13-14) The robot opened its gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 15-18) The robot moved away from the basket.
