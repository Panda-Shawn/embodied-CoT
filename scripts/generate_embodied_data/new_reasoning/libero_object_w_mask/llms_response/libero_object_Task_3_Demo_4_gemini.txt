## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered environment and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained a wooden surface with several objects: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The initial state of the BBQ sauce is not explicitly stated, but the trajectory suggests it was initially not in the basket. The basket's location is also not explicitly defined but is inferred to be within reach of the robot's arm.

The robot successfully executed the instruction "pick up the bbq sauce and place it in the basket".  The primary activity was manipulation of objects, and the intended outcome was the relocation of the BBQ sauce from its initial location into the basket.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce's general vicinity to prepare for grasping. This involved moving to a position suitable for gripping.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** Steps 4-7. The robot needed to reach, grip, and secure the BBQ sauce bottle.

3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** Steps 8-10. The robot needed to lift the BBQ sauce to clear any obstacles and create space to maneuver.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 11-20.  The robot needed to carefully maneuver around potential obstacles and move toward the basket. This is a longer process indicating the sauce was not immediately adjacent to the basket.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce:** Steps 21-24. The robot needed to position the BBQ sauce into the basket and release its grip.
