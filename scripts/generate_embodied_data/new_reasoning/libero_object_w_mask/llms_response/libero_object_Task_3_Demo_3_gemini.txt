## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The BBQ sauce was situated on the floor next to the basket. Other items nearby included a bottle of ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and a can of cream cheese, arranged linearly next to the BBQ sauce and basket. The robot needed to navigate to the BBQ sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, carefully placing it inside without damaging either the sauce or the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to pick up the BBQ sauce. This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the BBQ sauce.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 8-9) Once correctly positioned, the robot needed to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle securely.

3. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 11-16)  After grasping the sauce, the robot needed to lift the bottle and move it to the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 17-19) The robot needed to place the BBQ sauce into the basket carefully.


5. **Retreat:** (Step 20) The robot completes the task by stopping.
