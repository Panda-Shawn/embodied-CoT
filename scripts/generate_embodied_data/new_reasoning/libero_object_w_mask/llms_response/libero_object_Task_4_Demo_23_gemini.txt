## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and place it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle is assumed to be located to the right and somewhat lower than the robot's starting position. The basket is located to the left and higher than the ketchup bottle's position.  The robot needs to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The high-level movements are as follows:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-2. This involves moving the robot arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping.  This is necessary to get the manipulator arm into a suitable position for grasping the bottle.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 3-4. This involves closing the gripper to secure the ketchup bottle. This is the essential step in picking up the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 5-6. This involves lifting the grasped ketchup bottle to clear the surface. This is necessary to move the bottle without dragging it across the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-10. This involves moving the ketchup bottle to a position above the basket, accounting for a potential rotation if the bottle wasn't oriented correctly.  This is crucial for successfully placing the bottle into the basket.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 11-12. This involves opening the gripper to release the ketchup bottle into the basket. This completes the task.
