## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from an unknown location on a table and placing it in a basket.  The environment contained several other condiment bottles (ketchup, tomato sauce, etc.), alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk, all positioned around the table. The salad dressing's precise initial location was unknown to the robot, requiring a search and retrieval process. The basket's location was also assumed to be known, but its exact position relative to the dressing required navigational adjustment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Locate the salad dressing:**  (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to find the salad dressing among other objects on the table.  This involved navigating to a suitable starting point for the search.

2. **Approach and grasp the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-7) Once located, the robot needed to move to the salad dressing's position, adjust its arm position to grasp the bottle, and then close its gripper to secure it.

3. **Lift and transport the salad dressing:** (Steps 8-10) The robot needed to lift the salad dressing and then move it towards the basket.

4. **Position and place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 11-14) The robot needed to maneuver itself to a suitable position above the basket and then lower the salad dressing into the basket.

5. **Release and finish:** (Steps 15-16) Finally, the robot had to release the salad dressing into the basket and then stop.
