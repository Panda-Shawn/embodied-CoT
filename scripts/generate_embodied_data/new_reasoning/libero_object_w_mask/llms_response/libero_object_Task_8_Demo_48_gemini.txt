## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding and placing it in a basket located on the floor. The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, along with a basket. The pudding bottle was in a location that required the robot to move to reach it.  The basket was also on the floor, in a different location than the pudding.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Pudding:** Steps 0-4.  This involved moving the robotic arm to the location of the chocolate pudding bottle and grasping it using the gripper. This was necessary to acquire the object to be moved.

2. **Lift and Transport Pudding:** Steps 5-7.  This phase involved lifting the grasped pudding bottle and moving it towards the basket.  This was crucial to move the object from its initial location to the target location.

3. **Place Pudding in Basket:** Steps 8-13. This involved maneuvering the arm to position the pudding bottle above the basket and releasing it. This ensured successful completion of the task.
