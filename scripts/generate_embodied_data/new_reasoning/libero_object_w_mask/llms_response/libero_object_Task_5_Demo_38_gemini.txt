## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from an unspecified location and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle and the basket were positioned in such a way that the robot needed to navigate around obstacles (implied by the trajectory) to reach the sauce bottle and then the basket. The sauce bottle was likely located somewhat below the robot's initial position, requiring downward movement. The basket was likely to the left and possibly slightly upwards from the initial position of the robot.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach and grasp the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-10. This involved navigating to the sauce bottle's location, adjusting its orientation, and then grasping it using the gripper.  The robot needed to move forward, adjust the orientation to align with the bottle and then move down and close the gripper.
2. **Lift and transport the tomato sauce:** Steps 11-16. This involved lifting the sauce bottle and moving it towards the basket, adjusting the robot arm to avoid collision or optimize movement.
3. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 17-21. This involved positioning the sauce bottle above the basket and then releasing it. The robot needed to move the sauce above the basket and open the gripper.
