## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a chocolate pudding from a basket and placing it back in the same basket.  The basket was located on the floor. The chocolate pudding was initially inside the basket.  Other items – orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup – were also on the floor, but not directly relevant to the task.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the pudding remaining in the basket after the robot's manipulation.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the basket:** (Steps 0-2)  This movement was necessary to position the robot arm close enough to the basket to interact with the pudding.

2. **Pick up the pudding:** (Steps 3-5) This involved maneuvering the gripper to grasp the pudding.

3. **Lift the pudding:** (Steps 6-8)  The pudding needed to be lifted clear of the basket to avoid obstacles and ensure successful relocation.

4. **Move away from basket:** (Steps 9-11) This step provides space for placing the pudding back into the basket without accidental collision.

5. **Place the pudding back:** (Steps 12-16) This involved carefully positioning and releasing the pudding into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** (Steps 17)  This final step ensured the robot was clear of the area after completing the task.
