## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it into a basket located on the same floor.  The environment contained several other bottles (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) scattered around the floor, in addition to the chocolate pudding and basket. The basket was positioned on the floor, and the pudding bottle was situated somewhere among the other bottles.


The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4)  This involved navigating the robot arm to a position above the chocolate pudding bottle. This was necessary to enable grasping the bottle.

2. **Grasp the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 4-6) The robot closed its gripper around the pudding bottle, securing it for transport.

3. **Lift the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 6-9) This movement raised the pudding bottle off the floor, clearing it from the other obstacles.

4. **Move to the Basket:** (Steps 9-12) The arm moved the pudding bottle towards the basket's location.

5. **Position above the Basket:** (Steps 12-13) The robot arm carefully maneuvered itself to a position directly above the basket, ready to deposit the pudding.

6. **Release the Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 13-15) The robot opened its gripper, releasing the pudding into the basket.
