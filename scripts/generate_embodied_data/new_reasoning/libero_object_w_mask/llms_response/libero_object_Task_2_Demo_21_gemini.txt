## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment included several other items: ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce.  The salad dressing was situated near the basket and the cream cheese, while the ketchup was near the basket and the tomato sauce. The alphabet soup and milk were positioned together, separate from the other items.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 0-5)  The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the salad dressing bottle.  This involved navigating around other objects.

2. **Grasp the salad dressing:** (Steps 4-5) This involved reaching the salad dressing and using the gripper to secure it.

3. **Lift and move the salad dressing to the basket:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot had to lift the grasped salad dressing and move it towards the basket.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 9-13)  This involved positioning the salad dressing above the basket and releasing it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-18) The robot moved away from the basket after completing the task.
