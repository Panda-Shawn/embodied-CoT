## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The environment included a basket, salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce cartons, all situated on the floor. The salad dressing and ketchup were positioned near the basket, while the other items were somewhat dispersed. The primary activity was the manipulation of the salad dressing bottle, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from its initial location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 0-3)
    + Justification:  The robot needs to get close enough to the salad dressing before it can attempt to grasp it.

2. **Pick up the salad dressing:** This involved lowering the robotic arm to grasp the bottle. (Steps 4-6)
    + Justification:  The robot needs to lower its arm and close its gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Lift the salad dressing:** This involved raising the grasped bottle. (Steps 7-9)
    + Justification:  The bottle needs to be lifted clear of the surface to avoid obstacles and allow for transport to the basket.

4. **Move to the basket:** This involved moving the grasped bottle to the basket's location. (Steps 9-11)
    + Justification:  The robot needs to maneuver the bottle to the intended destination.

5. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** This involved lowering the arm and releasing the bottle into the basket. (Steps 11-14)
    + Justification: The robot needs to carefully position the bottle within the basket and release its grip.
