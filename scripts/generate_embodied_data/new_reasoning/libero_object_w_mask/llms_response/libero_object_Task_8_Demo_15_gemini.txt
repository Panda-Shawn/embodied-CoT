## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from the floor and placing it into a basket, also located on the floor.  The environment contained several other bottles (orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup) on the floor, all near the chocolate pudding and the basket. The primary activity was manipulation of the chocolate pudding bottle, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the floor to the basket. The high-level movements necessary to achieve this involved:

1. **Approaching the Chocolate Pudding:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above and close to the chocolate pudding bottle.  This spans steps 0-6.

2. **Grasping the Chocolate Pudding:** This involved lowering the gripper to engage with the bottle and securely hold it.  This spans steps 6-7.

3. **Lifting the Chocolate Pudding:** The robot then lifted the chocolate pudding bottle to clear it from the floor. This spans steps 8-9.

4. **Moving to the Basket:** The robot moved the chocolate pudding towards the basket. This spans steps 9-13.

5. **Placing the Chocolate Pudding in the Basket:** This involved carefully lowering the chocolate pudding into the basket and releasing it. This spans steps 14-17.

6. **Retreating:** The robot arm moved away from the basket after successful placement. This spans steps 18-21.
