## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was initially located to the robot's right and slightly lower than its starting position. The basket was located to the robot's left and at a similar height to its starting position.  The robot had to navigate to the ketchup, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket, carefully releasing it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-6) This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the ketchup bottle, orienting the gripper, and then closing the gripper to grasp the bottle. This was necessary to gain access to the ketchup bottle before manipulating it.

2. **Lift and Transport Ketchup:** (Steps 7-10) This involved lifting the ketchup bottle and moving it towards the basket.  This was essential to clear the ketchup from its initial location and prepare for placement in the basket.

3. **Approach Basket:** (Steps 11-13)  This involved positioning the arm above the basket to prepare for releasing the ketchup. This was a crucial step to accurately place the ketchup in the basket.

4. **Release Ketchup:** (Steps 14-15) This involved opening the gripper to release the ketchup bottle into the basket. This was the final stage of the task to complete the instruction.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 16-19) This involved the arm moving to a safe position away from the basket after completing the primary action of the task. This was necessary to avoid any potential collisions and prevent damage to the arm or the object.
