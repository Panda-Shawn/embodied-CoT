## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a table and placing it into a basket located on the floor nearby.  The environment contained several other items: a ketchup bottle, alphabet soup, milk, cream cheese, and tomato sauce, all positioned on a table or floor, with the salad dressing and basket situated relatively close to each other. The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket before releasing it.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move into a position where it could grasp the salad dressing bottle.  This involved navigating around any obstacles to get to the correct location.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 4-5) This stage focuses on securely grasping the salad dressing bottle.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifted the salad dressing bottle to a safe height to avoid collisions during transportation.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-11)  The robot moved the salad dressing bottle towards the basket.  This involved navigating potential obstacles and maneuvering to a position directly above the basket.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 11-14) This stage focused on carefully placing the salad dressing into the basket.
