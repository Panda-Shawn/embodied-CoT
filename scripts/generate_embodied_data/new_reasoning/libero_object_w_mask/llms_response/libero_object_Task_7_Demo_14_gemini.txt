## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was situated to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was assumed to be to the left of the robot's initial position, likely on the same surface.  The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve this goal includes:

1. **Approaching the Milk Carton:** This involves moving the robotic arm to a position above the milk carton, preparing for grasping. (Steps 0-4)

2. **Grasping the Milk Carton:**  This involves lowering the arm, tilting the gripper to engage with the carton, and closing the gripper to secure the carton. (Steps 4-7)

3. **Lifting the Milk Carton:**  This involves raising the arm, carrying the carton. (Steps 8-10)

4. **Moving to the Basket:** This involves moving the arm horizontally to a position above the basket. (Steps 10-12)

5. **Placing the Milk Carton in the Basket:** This involves lowering the arm, opening the gripper to release the carton into the basket. (Steps 12-17)
