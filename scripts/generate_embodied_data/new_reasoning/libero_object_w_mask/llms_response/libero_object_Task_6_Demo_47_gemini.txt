## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter located on the floor and placing it in a basket, also situated on the floor.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the butter using a robotic arm, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the butter from its initial position on the floor to the basket on the floor.  The objects involved were the butter (on the floor) and the basket (on the floor).  The robot needed to navigate to the butter, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket before releasing it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to position itself appropriately to reach the butter.  This involved navigating to a location near the butter, ensuring sufficient clearance for the subsequent grasping motion.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot had to lower its arm, adjust its gripper, and firmly grasp the butter. This involved precise movement to avoid knocking over the butter and accurate gripper closure to ensure secure handling.

3. **Lift and Transport Butter:** (Steps 9-13) The robot needed to lift the butter from the floor and carefully move it towards the basket. This required a controlled upward movement followed by horizontal movement to the basket's location.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 14-17) The robot needed to position itself above the basket and carefully release the butter. This involved precise lowering and releasing to avoid dropping the butter.


5. **Return to Home Position:** (Steps 18-19)  The robot returned to a default position after completing the task.
