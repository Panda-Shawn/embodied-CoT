## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a chocolate pudding from a table or floor and placing it into a basket.  Other objects—orange juice, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup—were present on the surface, scattered around the chocolate pudding and the basket. The robot's primary activity was manipulation, requiring precise movements to avoid colliding with other objects.  The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the chocolate pudding from its initial location to inside the basket.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach the Chocolate Pudding:** Steps 0-3. The robot needs to navigate to the pudding's general vicinity to be within reach. This involves maneuvering around other objects.
2. **Precise Positioning over the Pudding:** Steps 4-9. The robot must position its gripper directly above the pudding to accurately grasp it. This phase requires precise adjustments in vertical and rotational angles.
3. **Grasping the Pudding:** Steps 8-9. The robot closes its gripper to securely hold the pudding. This step confirms pudding acquisition.
4. **Lift and Transport the Pudding:** Steps 10-13. This involved lifting the pudding clear of the table and moving towards the basket.
5. **Approach the Basket:** Steps 14-17. Navigating to the target location (basket) to be ready to deposit the pudding.
6. **Precise Positioning over the Basket:** Steps 18-19. Positioning the pudding above the basket.
7. **Release the Pudding:** Steps 19-21. Opening the gripper to release the pudding into the basket.
8. **Retreat:** Steps 22-24.  The robot moves away from the basket, completing the task.
