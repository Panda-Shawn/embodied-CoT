## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface in front of the robot, and the basket was positioned somewhere within reach. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket. This requires a sequence of movements involving approaching the cream cheese, grasping, lifting, moving to the basket, and releasing.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3.  This phase involves navigating the robot arm to a position directly above the cream cheese.  This is necessary to allow for precise grasping.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-5. This phase involves actuating the gripper to secure the cream cheese. This is necessary to pick up the cream cheese.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 6-8.  This phase lifts the cream cheese from the surface. This is necessary to clear the cream cheese from the surface and allow for transport.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-10. This phase involves moving the cream cheese towards the basket's location. This is necessary to move the cream cheese to its desired destination.

5. **Position over Basket:** Steps 10-11. This stage precisely positions the cream cheese above the basket.  This ensures accurate placement within the basket.

6. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 12-14.  This phase releases the cream cheese into the basket.  This is the final action needed to complete the task.

7. **Retract Arm:** Steps 14-16. This stage retracts the arm to a safe and neutral position. This is to safely conclude the task.
