### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle is assumed to be located on a surface within reach of the robot arm. The basket is also within reach, but at a different location. The robot must execute a sequence of movements to first locate, grasp, and lift the orange juice bottle, then move it to the basket, and finally release it into the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 1-6. This movement involves positioning the robot arm over the orange juice bottle and then closing the gripper to secure it. It is necessary to acquire the object before it can be moved.

2. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** Steps 8-10.  This movement involves lifting the grasped bottle and moving it toward the basket. This stage is needed to clear the orange juice from its initial position and move it toward the target location.

3. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 11-14. This movement involves positioning the bottle above the basket and then opening the gripper to release the bottle. This is required to complete the task objective and place the object correctly within the basket.

4. **Retreat:** Steps 16-17. This movement involves moving the arm away from the basket, completing the task.
