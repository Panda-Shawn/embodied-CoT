### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice bottle was presumably located somewhat in front of and to the right of the robot's starting position. The basket was further away and to the left of the orange juice.  The robot needed to navigate to the juice, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, placing it inside.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 0-2. This movement was necessary to bring the robot arm into a position where it could reach the orange juice bottle.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 3-6. This involved moving the arm down to the juice, and then closing the gripper to secure it.

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** Steps 7-12. This stage involved lifting the juice bottle and moving it towards the basket.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 13-17.  This involved maneuvering the arm to position the juice above the basket, opening the gripper to release it, and then withdrawing the arm.
