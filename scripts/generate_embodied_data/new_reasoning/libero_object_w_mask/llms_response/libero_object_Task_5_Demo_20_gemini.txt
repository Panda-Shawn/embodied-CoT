## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of tomato sauce and place it in a basket.  The robot operates in an environment containing a basket on the floor, milk and butter on a table, a carton of orange juice, and a carton of chocolate pudding also on the floor, and the target tomato sauce (location unspecified initially). The high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal likely involve:

1. **Approaching the Tomato Sauce:** The robot needs to navigate to the location of the tomato sauce.  This will involve a series of movements to get it close enough to grasp the object.

2. **Grasping the Tomato Sauce:** The robot needs to position its gripper correctly to grasp the tomato sauce.  This involves fine adjustments in position and orientation.

3. **Lifting the Tomato Sauce:**  Once grasped, the robot lifts the tomato sauce to clear the surface it rests on.

4. **Moving to the Basket:** The robot needs to move the tomato sauce to the location of the basket. This will likely involve adjustments in height and orientation to ensure proper placement.

5. **Placing the Tomato Sauce:** The robot needs to carefully release the tomato sauce into the basket.

6. **Returning to a resting position:** The robot will move away from the basket and into a default or home position.


Based on the trajectory, I infer the following high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:


| High-Level Movement       | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Tomato Sauce | 0-6         | The robot moves forward, adjusting its orientation and vertical position to approach the sauce's location.|
| Grasping the Tomato Sauce  | 7-9         | The robot moves down, closes its gripper, and then moves up slightly to ensure a secure grip.             |
| Lifting the Tomato Sauce   | 10-13        | The robot lifts the sauce, adjusting its orientation.                                                     |
| Moving to the Basket      | 14-16       | The robot moves toward the basket, adjusting vertical position.                                         |
| Placing the Tomato Sauce   | 17-18       | The robot moves down, opens its gripper, releasing the sauce into the basket.                             |
| Returning to resting position | 19-21       | The robot stops and potentially goes to a default or resting position                                         |
