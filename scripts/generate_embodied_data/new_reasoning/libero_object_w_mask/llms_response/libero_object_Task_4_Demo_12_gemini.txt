## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it in a basket located on the floor.  The robot operated in an environment containing several other condiment bottles (bbq sauce, salad dressing, alphabet soup, cream cheese, and milk) and possibly other items, all situated on either a table or the floor. The precise spatial arrangement of these objects is not explicitly detailed, but the trajectory implies the ketchup is reachable without significant obstacle avoidance.  The basket's location is on the floor.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** (Steps 0-5) The robot moved into position to grasp the ketchup bottle. This involved positioning itself appropriately relative to the bottle's location.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** (Steps 6-7) The robot closed its gripper around the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** (Steps 8-9) The robot lifted the ketchup bottle from the surface.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-11) The robot moved the ketchup bottle towards the basket.

5. **Place Ketchup and Release:** (Steps 12-13) The robot positioned the ketchup bottle in the basket and opened its gripper to release it.
