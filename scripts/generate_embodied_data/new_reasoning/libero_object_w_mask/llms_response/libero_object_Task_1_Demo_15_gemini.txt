## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a container of cream cheese and placing it in a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface, and the basket was in a different location.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it carefully without damaging it, lift it, move to the basket, and carefully place it inside. The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:**  This involved moving the robotic arm towards the cream cheese, positioning itself for grasping.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:**  This involved positioning the gripper and closing it around the cream cheese. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift Cream Cheese:**  This involved lifting the cream cheese from the surface. (Steps 5-7)
4. **Move to Basket:** This involved navigating the robotic arm to the basketâ€™s location. (Steps 7-10)
5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** This involved lowering the cream cheese into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 10-16)
