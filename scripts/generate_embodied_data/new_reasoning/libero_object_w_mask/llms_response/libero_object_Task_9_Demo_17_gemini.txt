## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a bottle of orange juice and place it into a basket.  We assume the orange juice bottle is on a surface, and the basket is located at a different location. The robot needs to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:**  Steps 0-4. The robot needs to position itself in proximity to the orange juice bottle to reach it with its gripper. This involves navigating around obstacles and reaching the appropriate location above the bottle.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 5-6. The robot lowers itself and closes its gripper to firmly grasp the orange juice bottle.

3. **Lift and Transport Orange Juice:** Steps 7-9.  The robot lifts the orange juice bottle and begins to move it towards the basket.

4. **Position above Basket:** Steps 10-12. The robot moves to a position directly above the basket, preparing to release the orange juice bottle.

5. **Release Orange Juice:** Steps 13-14. The robot lowers itself and opens its gripper to release the orange juice bottle into the basket.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 15. The robot moves away from the basket to complete the task.
