## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of alphabet soup from a table and place it in a basket located on the same table.  The robot operates in an environment containing several other objects on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce.  Butter is located elsewhere.  The primary activity is the manipulation of the alphabet soup container, involving reaching for it, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, and releasing it. The intended outcome is the successful transfer of the alphabet soup from its original location to the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the Alphabet Soup:** Steps 0-2.  The robot needs to position itself to reach the alphabet soup. This involves moving to a suitable location relative to the soup container to allow for subsequent gripping.

2. **Grasp the Alphabet Soup:** Steps 3-4. The robot needs to grip the alphabet soup container securely. This requires moving the gripper into a position to grasp the container.

3. **Lift and Transport the Alphabet Soup to the Basket:** Steps 5-7.  The robot must lift the alphabet soup and carry it to the basket. A high vertical movement is necessary to clear obstacles and ensure safe transport.

4. **Place the Alphabet Soup in the Basket:** Steps 8-12. The robot must place the container into the basket. This involves precise maneuvering to avoid dropping the container and also requires releasing the grip.


5. **Return to Neutral Position:** Steps 13.  The robot returns to a default position after completing the task.
