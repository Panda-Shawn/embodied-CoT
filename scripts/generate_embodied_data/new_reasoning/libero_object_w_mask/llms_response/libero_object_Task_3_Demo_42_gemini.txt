## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a cluttered surface and placing it in a basket. The environment contained a wooden surface with various food items including BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. The BBQ sauce bottle was initially located near other objects on the surface, and the basket was also on the surface. The goal was to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle and place it inside the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the BBQ sauce bottle. This involved maneuvering around other obstacles to reach a position suitable for grasping.

2. **Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 4-6)  Once near the BBQ sauce, the robot needed to precisely position its gripper and grasp the bottle securely.

3. **Lift BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-12) After grasping, the robot had to lift the bottle clear of the surrounding objects to prevent collisions during transport.

4. **Transport to Basket:** (Steps 13-20) The robot had to move the grasped BBQ sauce to the basket while avoiding obstacles.

5. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 20-26) The robot needed to position the BBQ sauce within the basket and then release it.
