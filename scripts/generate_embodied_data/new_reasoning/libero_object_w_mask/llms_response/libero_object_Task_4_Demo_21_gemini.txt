## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup and placing it in a basket.  The ketchup bottle was initially located on a surface, requiring the robot arm to reach it, grasp it, and then move it to a basket positioned at a different location.  The basket is assumed to be within reach once the ketchup bottle is picked up.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** The robot needs to maneuver its arm to a position near the ketchup bottle, preparing for grasping.
2. **Grasp Ketchup:** The robot must then grasp the bottle securely using its gripper.
3. **Lift Ketchup:**  After grasping, the robot must lift the ketchup bottle away from its resting position.
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot needs to move the ketchup bottle to the location of the basket.
5. **Place Ketchup:** The robot must carefully place the ketchup into the basket.
6. **Depart:** The robot returns to a resting position.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

| High-Level Movement | Trajectory Steps | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach Ketchup | 0-3 | The robot needs to position itself above the ketchup bottle to prepare for gripping. Steps 0-3 involve maneuvering to an optimal position before grasping. |
| Grasp Ketchup | 4-6 | This involves moving down to the ketchup and closing the gripper to ensure a secure hold. |
| Lift Ketchup | 7-9 | This involves lifting the ketchup bottle from the surface after successful gripping. |
| Move to Basket | 10-12 | Moving the ketchup to the basket's location. |
| Place Ketchup | 13-15 | The robot moves down, opens its gripper, placing the ketchup in the basket. |
