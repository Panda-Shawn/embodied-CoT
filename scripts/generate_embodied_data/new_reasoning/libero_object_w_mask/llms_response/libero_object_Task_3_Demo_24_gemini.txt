## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a bottle of BBQ sauce from a table and placing it in a basket on the floor.  The relevant objects were the BBQ sauce, a basket, and several other condiment bottles (ketchup, chocolate pudding, salad dressing, and alphabet soup). The BBQ sauce was located next to the basket, which was situated on the floor. The other condiments were arranged linearly next to the BBQ sauce.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to move to the location of the BBQ sauce and grasp it with its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 6-8) The robot lifts the BBQ sauce and moves it to a position above the basket.

3. **Position above Basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot precisely positions the BBQ sauce above the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 12-13) The robot releases the BBQ sauce into the basket.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 14-16) The robot moves away from the basket.
