## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The orange juice was positioned on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was located some distance away.  The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it, then move it to the basket, carefully releasing it into the basket.

The high-level movements identified, based on the provided trajectory, are:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** Steps 0-6. The robot needs to move towards the orange juice to reach a position where it can grasp it. This involves navigating any obstacles and positioning itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** Steps 6-7. Once in position, the robot must grasp the orange juice securely using its gripper.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 8-12. The robot must transport the orange juice to the basket while maintaining a stable grip.  This likely involves a combination of upward, lateral, and downward movements to avoid collisions.

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** Steps 12-15.  The robot needs to position the orange juice above the basket and release it gently without dropping it or damaging the bottle.
