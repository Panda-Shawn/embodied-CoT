## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a ketchup bottle from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The ketchup bottle was located on a surface to the right and slightly below the robot's starting position. The basket was positioned to the left and slightly above the robot's starting position.  The robot needed to navigate to the ketchup bottle, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the basket, and deposit the ketchup bottle into the basket.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-4. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the ketchup bottle to grasp it.  The robot needed to move right and down to reach the appropriate position.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-6.  This movement involved closing the gripper to secure the ketchup bottle.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-10.  This involved lifting the ketchup bottle clear of the surface.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 10-17. The robot needed to move to the location of the basket after picking up the ketchup.

5. **Place Ketchup in Basket:** Steps 18-20. This stage involved carefully positioning the ketchup bottle within the basket.

6. **Release Ketchup:** Steps 20-22. The robot opened the gripper to release the ketchup bottle.

7. **Retreat:** Steps 22-24. This stage involved pulling the robot away from the area of the basket.
