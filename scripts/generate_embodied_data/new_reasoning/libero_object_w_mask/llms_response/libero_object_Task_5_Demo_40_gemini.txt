## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was located on a surface within the robot's reach, and the basket was positioned to the left and slightly elevated relative to the sauce bottle's starting location.  The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, and then move it to the basket, carefully releasing it inside.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 0-7)  This phase involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above the tomato sauce bottle and closing the gripper to secure it.  It's crucial for successful completion to ensure a stable grip for subsequent manipulation.

2. **Lift the Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 8-14)  This involved vertically lifting the sauce bottle, ensuring a clear trajectory to avoid obstacles and maintain a secure grip.  This is important to safely transport the bottle to the basket.

3. **Transport to the Basket:** (Steps 15-18)  This stage focuses on moving the sauce bottle horizontally towards the basket. The elevation of the basket might necessitate some vertical adjustments.

4. **Place the Tomato Sauce in the Basket and Retract:** (Steps 19-24)  Here, the robot lowers the bottle into the basket, releases its grip, and then retracts its arm to its original or a safe resting position. It is crucial to accurately position the bottle and release it gently to avoid spilling.
