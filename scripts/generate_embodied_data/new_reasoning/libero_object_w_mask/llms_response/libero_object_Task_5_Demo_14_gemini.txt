## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a carton of tomato sauce and place it in a basket located on the floor.  The robot operates in an environment containing several other items: milk and butter on a table, and orange juice and chocolate pudding cartons on the floor.  The tomato sauce is implicitly assumed to be on the floor, given the trajectory. The robot needs to navigate to the tomato sauce, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket.  The high-level movements likely involved are:

1. **Approach Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needs to navigate to a position above the tomato sauce, positioning itself for grasping. This involves maneuvering around potential obstacles.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 8-10) The robot extends its gripper to grasp the tomato sauce.

3. **Lift Tomato Sauce:** (Steps 11-14)  The robot lifts the tomato sauce, clearing it from the floor.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 15-21) The robot moves to a position above the basket.

5. **Place Tomato Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 22-26) The robot carefully lowers the tomato sauce into the basket and releases its grip.
