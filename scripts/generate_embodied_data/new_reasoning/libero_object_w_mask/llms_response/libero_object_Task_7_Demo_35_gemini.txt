### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a milk carton from a location and place it in a basket.  We assume the milk carton is initially on a surface and the basket is some distance away. The robot needs to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and release it.  The general sequence of high-level movements are:

1. **Approach Milk:** The robot must move to a position above the milk carton, preparing to grasp it.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp Milk:** The robot must grasp the milk carton using its gripper. (Steps 4-5)
3. **Lift Milk:** The robot must lift the milk carton from the surface. (Steps 6-8)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot must move the grasped milk carton to a position above the basket. (Steps 9-11)
5. **Place Milk:** The robot must release the milk carton into the basket. (Steps 12-14)
6. **Retreat:** The robot may move away from the basket to conclude the task. (Steps 15-18)
