## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a container of cream cheese and place it in a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface, likely a table or countertop, and the basket was positioned elsewhere within the robot's reach. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket's location, and then carefully place it inside the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the cream cheese, grasping the cream cheese, lifting the cream cheese, moving to the basket, positioning above the basket, and releasing the cream cheese into the basket.

The high-level movements, along with their corresponding trajectory steps, are as follows:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 1-7.  This movement was necessary to bring the robot arm into a position where it could grasp the cream cheese.  The robot needed to move towards the cream cheese, adjusting its position to approach from an optimal angle for grasping.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 8-9. This movement was crucial for securing the cream cheese before lifting.  The robot needed to close its gripper around the cream cheese to ensure a stable grip.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 11-12. This movement was necessary to raise the cream cheese clear of the surface, allowing for transport to the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 13-14. This involved moving the robot arm to the basket's location.

5. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 14-15. This was necessary to precisely position the cream cheese above the basket's opening, preparing for release.

6. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 15-16. The robot opened its gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket.

7. **Stop:** Steps 17-19.  The robot completed the task.
