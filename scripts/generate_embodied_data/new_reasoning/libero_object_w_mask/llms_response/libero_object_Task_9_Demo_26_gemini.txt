## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice and placing it in a basket.  The orange juice was located on a surface, presumably a table or countertop, while the basket was positioned at a different location, potentially further away. The robot needed to navigate to the orange juice, grasp it securely, transport it to the basket, and then release it.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** The robot needed to move to a position where it could reach the orange juice.  This involves navigation and positioning. *(Steps 0-3)*.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** The robot needed to pick up the orange juice bottle using its gripper. *(Steps 4-6)*

3. **Transport Orange Juice to Basket:** The robot had to move the grasped orange juice to the basket. *(Steps 7-11)*

4. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** The robot needed to release the orange juice into the basket. *(Steps 12-15)*
