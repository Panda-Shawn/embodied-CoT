## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robot arm, and the basket was also within the robot's workspace.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it into the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:**  The robot needs to move itself to a position where it can reach the cream cheese. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:**  The robot must accurately position its gripper above the cream cheese and then close its gripper to secure a grasp. (Steps 4-5)
3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** The robot needs to lift the cream cheese from the surface. (Steps 6-7)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot must transport the cream cheese to the location of the basket. (Steps 8-11)
5. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** The robot must position the cream cheese above the basket and release it. (Steps 12-16)
