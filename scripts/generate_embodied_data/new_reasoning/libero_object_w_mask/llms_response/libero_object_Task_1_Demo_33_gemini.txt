## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be within reach of the robot arm, and the basket was positioned at a different location. The primary activity was manipulation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the cream cheese from its initial position to the basket.

The following high-level movements were likely followed:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3. The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the cream cheese. This involved navigating towards the general area where the cream cheese was located.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-8.  The robot needed to position its gripper above the cream cheese and then close the gripper to securely grasp it. This required precise maneuvering to align the gripper with the cream cheese.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 9-12.  After successfully grasping the cream cheese, the robot had to move to the location of the basket. This likely involved navigating around potential obstacles and aiming for the basket's position.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 13-16. Finally, the robot needed to place the cream cheese into the basket. This involved carefully lowering the cream cheese into the basket and then opening the gripper to release it.
