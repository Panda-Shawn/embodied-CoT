## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of salad dressing from a cluttered environment and placing it into a basket. The environment contained a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, milk and cream cheese on a table, alphabet soup and tomato sauce also on the floor.  The primary activity was to selectively pick up the salad dressing, avoiding other items, and then deposit it into the basket. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the salad dressing from its initial location to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needed to navigate to the salad dressing bottle.  This involved maneuvering around other objects on the floor to reach the optimal position for grasping the dressing.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 6-7) Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to securely grasp the salad dressing bottle.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 8-10) After grasping, the robot had to lift the bottle vertically, clearing it from the surrounding environment to avoid collisions.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 11-12) Next, the robot needed to move the salad dressing to the basket, likely requiring adjustments in position and orientation to properly align for placement.

5. **Place Salad Dressing:** (Steps 13-15) The robot needed to carefully place the salad dressing into the basket.  This involved precise lowering and release to avoid dropping the dressing.
