## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a surface and placing it into a basket on the floor.  The environment contained several food items: a basket on the floor, salad dressing and ketchup bottles near the basket, milk and cream cheese in the center, and alphabet soup and tomato sauce on a table.  The robot needed to selectively grasp the salad dressing, avoiding the other objects. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the salad dressing, grasping the salad dressing, lifting the salad dressing, moving to the basket, and placing the salad dressing in the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** Steps 0-4.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the salad dressing to grasp it. The robot needed to navigate around other obstacles and position itself appropriately for the grasping action.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** Steps 5-8. This was crucial to secure the salad dressing for transport.  The robot needed to precisely position its gripper and close it securely.

3. **Lift and Transport Salad Dressing:** Steps 9-12. This movement moved the grasped salad dressing clear of the original location. The robot needed to lift the salad dressing to avoid collision and move it to the basket location.

4. **Position over Basket:** Steps 13-16. This was needed to accurately position the salad dressing above the basket for placement. This step needed accurate positioning over the basket.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** Steps 14-16.  This step involved opening the gripper above the basket to deposit the salad dressing. This was the final action to complete the task.
6. **Final Stop:** Steps 17-18. This ends the robot's motion.
