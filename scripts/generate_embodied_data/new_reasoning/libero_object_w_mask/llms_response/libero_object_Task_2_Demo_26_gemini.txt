## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the salad dressing bottle from the floor and place it in the basket. The environment contains a basket on the floor with alphabet soup and tomato sauce inside.  Near the basket are bottles of salad dressing and ketchup. A table holds milk and cream cheese. The primary activity is manipulation: the robot must locate the salad dressing, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket. The intended outcome is the salad dressing being placed successfully inside the basket without disturbing other items.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needs to position itself to reach the salad dressing bottle.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 5-6) The robot must close its gripper around the salad dressing bottle.

3. **Lift and Rotate Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-11) The robot needs to lift the salad dressing and potentially orient it for easier placement in the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 12-15) The robot moves toward the basket.

5. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 15-18) The robot carefully places the salad dressing in the basket.
