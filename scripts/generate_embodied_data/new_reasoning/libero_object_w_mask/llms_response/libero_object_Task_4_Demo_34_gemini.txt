## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of ketchup from a surface and placing it into a basket. The ketchup bottle was initially located on a surface, presumably a table or counter, requiring the robot to navigate to its position.  The basket was located at some distance from the ketchup, necessitating movement after grasping the ketchup. The robot had to execute a series of coordinated movements to achieve this goal: approaching the ketchup, grasping it, lifting it, and finally placing it in the basket.

We can identify the following high-level movements in the robot's trajectory:

1. **Approach Ketchup:** Steps 0-3. The robot initially needs to move into a position where it can reach the ketchup bottle. This involves positioning itself correctly to grasp the object.

2. **Grasp Ketchup:** Steps 4-5.  Once positioned, the robot needs to close its gripper around the ketchup bottle to securely hold it.

3. **Lift Ketchup:** Steps 6-7. After grasping, the robot needs to lift the ketchup bottle to avoid any collisions during transport.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** Steps 8-11. With the ketchup held, the robot then needs to move towards the basket, navigating any obstacles.

5. **Place Ketchup:** Steps 12-15. The robot needs to accurately position the bottle over the basket and release it gently to avoid dropping it.
