## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm. The basket was situated at a different location than the cream cheese, requiring the robot to move to pick up the cream cheese and then to a new location to place it.  The robot had to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, move to the basket, and deposit it there.  The high-level movements necessary were:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese (Steps 0-6):** This involved navigating to the cream cheese and securing a grasp on it.  The robot needed to position itself correctly to avoid obstacles, approach the cream cheese from an appropriate angle, and then engage its gripper.

2. **Transport Cream Cheese to Basket (Steps 7-11):** This stage involved moving the cream cheese from its initial location to the location of the basket, while maintaining a secure grip.  This required navigating around potential obstacles and ensuring the cheese remained upright and secure.

3. **Release Cream Cheese into Basket (Steps 12-14):** This stage involves opening the gripper above the basket to deposit the cream cheese. The robot needed to position the cream cheese accurately to avoid dropping it outside the basket.

4. **Retreat (Steps 15-18):** The robot retracts to a safe location after successfully placing the cream cheese in the basket
