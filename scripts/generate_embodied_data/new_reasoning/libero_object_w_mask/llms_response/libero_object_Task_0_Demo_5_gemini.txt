### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The robot's task was to pick up a container of alphabet soup from a table and place it in a basket located on the same table.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the alphabet soup from its initial location to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the alphabet soup, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, placing it in the basket, and then returning to a stop position.

High-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

1. **Approach Alphabet Soup:** Steps 0-2.  This movement was necessary to position the robot arm close enough to the alphabet soup to grasp it.

2. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** Steps 3-4. This movement was necessary to securely hold the alphabet soup for transport.

3. **Lift Alphabet Soup:** Steps 5-6. This movement lifted the soup container to allow for unobstructed movement towards the basket.

4. **Move to Basket:** Steps 7-10. This movement transported the grasped soup to the basket's location.

5. **Place Alphabet Soup:** Steps 11-12. This movement released the soup container into the basket.

6. **Return to Stop Position:** Steps 13. This movement concluded the task and returned the robot to its initial position.
