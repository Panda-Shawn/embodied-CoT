## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a bottle of BBQ sauce from a location within a basket and placing it in a designated basket.  The environment consisted of a table or floor with various food items, including the target BBQ sauce already situated inside a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese. Other objects were scattered around. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the BBQ sauce successfully moved and positioned within the target basket (presumably a different basket or a different position within the same basket).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the Basket:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the basket containing the BBQ sauce. This involved maneuvering around other objects on the table/floor.

2. **Reach and Grasp the BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 5-9)  The robot had to position its gripper above the BBQ sauce bottle within the basket, lower itself precisely to grasp the bottle, and then close its gripper securely.

3. **Lift and Move the BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 10-12) The robot needed to lift the BBQ sauce, ensuring a stable grip, and then move it away from the initial basket.

4. **Place the BBQ Sauce in the Target Basket:** (Steps 13-17)  This involved maneuvering the BBQ sauce to the target location and precisely releasing it using the gripper.
