## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The tomato sauce bottle was positioned on a surface, likely a table, and the basket was located some distance away. The robot needed to navigate to the sauce bottle, grasp it securely, lift it, navigate to the basket, and carefully place it inside without dropping it.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Sauce Bottle:** (Steps 0-8)  This involved moving the robotic arm towards the tomato sauce bottle, positioning its gripper appropriately, and then grasping the bottle. This was necessary to secure the object before lifting.

2. **Lift and Transport Sauce Bottle:** (Steps 9-12)  This phase involved lifting the sauce bottle and moving it towards the basket. The upward movement was to clear the surface, and the horizontal movement was to navigate to the basket.

3. **Position and Place in Basket:** (Steps 13-18)  This phase involved positioning the bottle above the basket and then carefully placing it inside. This required precise movements to avoid dropping the bottle and ensure it was fully within the basket.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 19) This phase is a final stop to signal task completion.
