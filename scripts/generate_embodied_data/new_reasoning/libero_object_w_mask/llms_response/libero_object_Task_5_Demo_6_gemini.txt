## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a carton of tomato sauce from an unspecified location and placing it in a basket located on the floor. The environment contained several other items: milk and butter on a table, and orange juice and chocolate pudding on the floor.  The basket's location on the floor is crucial, as is the unknown location of the tomato sauce.  The robot needed to navigate to the sauce, grasp it, and then navigate to the basket to deposit it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to the tomato sauce:** This involved a series of movements to approach the sauce's location. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** This involved reaching the sauce, aligning the gripper, and grasping the carton. (Steps 5-9)
3. **Navigate to the basket:** This involved a series of movements to move the grasped sauce to the basket's location. (Steps 11-15)
4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This involved positioning the sauce above the basket and releasing it. (Steps 16-18)
5. **Return to a resting position:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a safe and neutral position (Steps 19-20)
