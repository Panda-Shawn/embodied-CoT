## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere. The primary activity was the manipulation of the alphabet soup container, requiring precise movements to avoid collisions with other objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the soup from its original location to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to navigate to the location of the alphabet soup.  This involved avoiding obstacles (other food items on the table).

2. **Grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 4-12) The robot had to position its gripper above the soup and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and transport the alphabet soup:** (Steps 13-17) The robot needed to lift the soup container and move it to the basket.  This required careful control to prevent dropping the soup and avoiding collisions with the other items on the table.

4. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** (Steps 17-20) The robot had to position the soup container above the basket and release its grip.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 21-22) The robot moved away from the basket after completing the task.
