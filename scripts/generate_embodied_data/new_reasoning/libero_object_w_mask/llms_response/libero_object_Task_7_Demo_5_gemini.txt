## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from an unspecified location and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton and basket are assumed to be within the robot's reachable workspace. The robot needed to navigate to the milk carton, grasp it securely, lift it, move to the basket, and then carefully place the milk carton into the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary are:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above and near the milk carton.  (Steps 0-2)

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:**  The robot needs to lower its gripper, close it around the milk carton, and ensure a secure grip. (Steps 3-4)

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** Once grasped, the robot must lift the milk carton vertically. (Steps 5-8)

4. **Move to Basket:** The robot needs to transport the milk carton to a position above the basket. (Steps 9-16)

5. **Place Milk Carton in Basket:** This involves lowering the milk carton into the basket and releasing it. (Steps 17-21)
