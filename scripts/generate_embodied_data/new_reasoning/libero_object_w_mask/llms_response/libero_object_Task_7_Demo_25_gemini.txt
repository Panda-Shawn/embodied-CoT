## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a milk carton from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The milk carton was positioned to the robot's right and slightly forward. The basket was located to the robot's left and slightly forward. The primary activity was manipulation of the milk carton, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the carton from its initial position to the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Milk Carton:** (Steps 0-3)  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above and slightly to the side of the milk carton, preparing for grasping.  This was necessary to position the arm for precise grasping.

2. **Grasp Milk Carton:** (Steps 4-7) This involved descending to the carton, closing the gripper to secure it. This step was critical for successful object manipulation.

3. **Lift Milk Carton:** (Steps 8-10) The robot raised the grasped milk carton upward, creating a safe distance from the original position. This was needed to avoid collision during transportation.

4. **Transport Milk Carton:** (Steps 11-13) This stage involved moving the arm horizontally toward the basket's position, carefully carrying the milk carton. This was necessary to move the carton to the basket without spilling.

5. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 14-15) The robot positioned itself above the basket, precisely aligning the carton for placement. This stage was critical for successful placement.

6. **Place Milk Carton:** (Steps 16-17) This involved lowering the carton and opening the gripper to release it into the basket. This action completes the main task objective.

7. **Retreat:** (Steps 18) This final step involved the robot stopping after successful completion of the task.
