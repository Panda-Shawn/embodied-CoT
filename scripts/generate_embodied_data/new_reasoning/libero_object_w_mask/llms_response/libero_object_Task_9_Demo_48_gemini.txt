## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of orange juice from a location on a surface and placing it into a basket.  The orange juice bottle was assumed to be located to the right and slightly in front of the robot's starting position. The basket was assumed to be located to the left and slightly in front of the robotâ€™s starting position.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Orange Juice:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the orange juice bottle. This involved navigating to the juice, which was to the right and slightly ahead of the robot's starting position.

2. **Grasp Orange Juice:** (Steps 4-6)  The robot needed to position its gripper correctly to pick up the bottle and close its gripper to securely hold it.

3. **Lift Orange Juice:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needed to lift the orange juice bottle from the surface after grasping it.

4. **Navigate to Basket:** (Steps 9-11) The robot had to move the bottle to the basket. This involved moving to the left towards the basket.

5. **Place Orange Juice in Basket:** (Steps 12-14) The robot had to lower the bottle into the basket and release its grip on the bottle.


6. **Finish:** (Step 15) The robot concludes the task.
