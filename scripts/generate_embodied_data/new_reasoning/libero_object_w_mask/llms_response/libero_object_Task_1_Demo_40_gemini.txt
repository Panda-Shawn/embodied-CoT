## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a cream cheese container from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was assumed to be located on a surface within the robot's reach, and the basket was located to the left and slightly above the cream cheese's initial position.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it, lift it, and transport it to the basket before releasing it.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-3. This involved moving the robotic arm towards the cream cheese, positioning itself for grasping. Justification: The robot needs to be close enough to the cream cheese to interact with it.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 3-4. This involved closing the gripper around the cream cheese. Justification:  This is necessary to secure the object before lifting.

3. **Lift Cream Cheese:** Steps 10-11. This stage involved lifting the cream cheese from its initial location.  Justification:  The cheese must be lifted to be transported.

4. **Transport Cream Cheese to Basket:** Steps 11-13.  The robot moved horizontally to the basket. Justification: This is the movement to bring the cream cheese to the target location.

5. **Position Above Basket:** Steps 13-14. This involved positioning the cream cheese above the basket. Justification: Accurate placement is needed for successful delivery.

6. **Release Cream Cheese:** Steps 14-17. This involved opening the gripper to release the cream cheese into the basket. Justification: This action completes the task goal.
