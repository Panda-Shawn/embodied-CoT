## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket.  The robot's environment included a table or floor with several objects: salad dressing, a basket, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce.  The salad dressing was initially located on the table near other items. The basket was also on the table. The goal was to move the salad dressing from its initial position to inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** This involves navigating to a position above the salad dressing bottle. (Steps 1-2)
2. **Lower the gripper to grasp the salad dressing:** The arm moves downwards to reach the dressing. (Steps 3-6)
3. **Grasp the salad dressing:** The gripper closes around the bottle. (Steps 5-6)
4. **Lift the salad dressing:** The arm lifts to secure the bottle. (Steps 7-9)
5. **Move the salad dressing to the basket:** The arm moves to the basket's location. (Steps 9-11)
6. **Lower the salad dressing into the basket:** The arm lowers to place the dressing inside. (Steps 11-12)
