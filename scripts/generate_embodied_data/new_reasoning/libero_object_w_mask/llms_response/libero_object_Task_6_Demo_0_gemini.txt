1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The robot's task was to pick up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and place it in a basket on the floor.  The environment contained several other items on the floor near the butter and the basket: bottles of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of ketchup next to the basket. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the butter from its initial location to the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needs to navigate to the location of the butter, avoiding obstacles. This involves maneuvering around other items on the floor.
2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 6-7) The robot needs to position its gripper above the butter and then close it to secure a grasp.
3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 8-9) The robot needs to lift the butter from the surface, ensuring a stable grip.
4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-13) The robot needs to move the butter to the vicinity of the basket, avoiding collisions with other objects.
5. **Place Butter:** (Steps 14-18) The robot needs to position the butter above the basket and release it.
