## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a stick of butter from a surface and place it in a basket located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects on the floor: bottles of sauce, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of chocolate pudding, and a bottle of ketchup next to the basket. The butter's precise location isn't specified, but it's assumed to be reachable by the robot arm.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** This involves navigating to a position above the butter, ready to grasp it. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp Butter:** The robot lowers its gripper to pick up the butter. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift Butter:** The robot lifts the grasped butter. (Steps 5-7)
4. **Move to Basket:** The robot moves to a position above the basket. (Steps 7-9)
5. **Lower Butter:** The robot lowers the butter into the basket. (Steps 10-11)
6. **Release Butter:** The robot releases the butter into the basket. (Step 11)
7. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the basket. (Step 12)
