## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a stick of butter from a cluttered surface and placing it into a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained the butter, a basket, a bottle of ketchup next to the basket, a bottle of bbq sauce near the basket, a can of tomato sauce, a bottle of orange juice, and a bottle of chocolate pudding, all situated on the floor. The robot needed to navigate this cluttered space to selectively grasp the butter and deposit it in the basket without interfering with other objects.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 1-7)  The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the butter without colliding with other objects. This involved maneuvering around the surrounding items.

2. **Grasp Butter:** (Steps 7-9) Once appropriately positioned, the robot had to grasp the butter securely.  This requires careful positioning and gripper manipulation.

3. **Lift Butter:** (Steps 9-12)  After grasping, the robot needed to lift the butter clear of the surface, ensuring a stable hold.

4. **Approach Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot then needed to navigate to the basket, again avoiding collisions with other objects on the floor.  This involves adjusting orientation to ensure proper placement.

5. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 17-29) Finally, the robot needed to carefully place the butter into the basket, releasing its grip.

Note: Steps 10, 11, 16, 17, and 19 show inconsistencies in the provided trajectory. A well-trained RL agent should not open the gripper after successfully grasping the butter (steps 10, 11) and  should not attempt to close the gripper again after already having it closed (steps 16, 17).  Step 19 shows an unexpected upward movement while placing the butter.  These suggest issues with the training or the trajectory data itself.
