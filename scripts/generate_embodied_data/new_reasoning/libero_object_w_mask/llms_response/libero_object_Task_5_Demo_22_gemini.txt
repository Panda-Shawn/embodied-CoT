## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a tomato sauce bottle from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The sauce bottle was located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, and the basket was positioned at a location that required the arm to navigate around obstacles or reposition itself. The relative locations of the sauce bottle and basket were such that a direct path was not possible.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 0-8) The robot needed to maneuver itself to a position where it could grasp the sauce bottle. This involved moving towards the sauce bottle and adjusting its orientation for a suitable grip.

2. **Lift the tomato sauce:** (Steps 9-12) After grasping the bottle, the robot had to lift it from the surface. This required an upward movement.

3. **Transport the tomato sauce to the basket:** (Steps 13-24) This stage involved navigating the robot arm around any obstacles and moving towards the basket, maintaining a stable grip on the sauce bottle. The movement implied a non-straight path, possibly involving lateral and vertical adjustments.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 25-29)  The robot needed to position the bottle above the basket and then release it carefully.  This stage involved lowering the arm and opening the gripper to release the bottle.
