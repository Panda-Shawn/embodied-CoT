1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a container of alphabet soup from a table and place it in a basket.  The alphabet soup is located on a table along with other items: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter is located elsewhere. The basket is also on the table or wooden floor. The robot needs to navigate to the alphabet soup, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket.  It must avoid colliding with other objects on the table.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach and Grasp Alphabet Soup:** This movement involves positioning the robotic arm to reach the alphabet soup and grasp it securely. This covers steps 0-6.  It's necessary to initiate the task by bringing the arm into a position to interact with the soup.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Lift and Transport Alphabet Soup:** This involves lifting the alphabet soup and moving it to the basket. This is covered by steps 7-10. This is essential for moving the soup to the desired location.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** This involves carefully positioning the soup container in the basket and releasing it. This is accomplished in steps 11-16.  It's crucial for completing the task successfully.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Return to Home Position:** This involves moving the arm back to a neutral resting position. This covers steps 17-19.  This ensures the safety and readiness of the robot for subsequent tasks.
