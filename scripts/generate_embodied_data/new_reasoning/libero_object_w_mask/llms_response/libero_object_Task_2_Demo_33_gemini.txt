## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the salad dressing bottle and place it in the basket. The environment contains a basket on the floor, a salad dressing bottle, a ketchup bottle near the basket, and several other items (alphabet soup, milk, cream cheese, tomato sauce) not directly involved in the task.  The salad dressing and ketchup are positioned near the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the salad dressing:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can grasp the salad dressing bottle. This involves moving forward and slightly adjusting its position to approach the bottle.

2. **Grasp the salad dressing:** (Steps 5-7)  The robot needs to lower its gripper to a position where it can effectively grasp the salad dressing bottle, and then close the gripper to secure the bottle.

3. **Lift and move to the basket:** (Steps 9-12)  The robot needs to lift the salad dressing bottle and transport it to the basket. This involves moving upwards to clear any obstacles, and then moving horizontally towards the basket.

4. **Place the salad dressing in the basket:** (Steps 13-15)  The robot needs to lower the salad dressing bottle into the basket and release it. This includes descending to the basket's height and opening its gripper to release the bottle.
