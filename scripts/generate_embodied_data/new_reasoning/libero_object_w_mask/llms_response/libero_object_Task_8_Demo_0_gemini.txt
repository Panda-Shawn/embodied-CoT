## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up the chocolate pudding and place it in the basket. The robot operated in an environment containing a wooden floor or table with several objects scattered on it: chocolate pudding, a basket, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, and alphabet soup. The chocolate pudding was initially not in the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to the pudding, grasp it, and then move it to the basket.  This required a sequence of movements involving reaching the pudding, picking it up, and then navigating to the basket's location before finally placing the pudding inside.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Pudding:** Steps 1-3. The robot positions itself near the chocolate pudding.  This is necessary to allow for grasping the pudding in the following steps.

2. **Grasp Pudding:** Steps 3-5. The robot extends its gripper and closes it around the chocolate pudding. This ensures the pudding is securely held for the next phase of the task.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-10. The robot moves the pudding to the location of the basket. This step is crucial for depositing the pudding into the basket, completing the task.

4. **Place Pudding in Basket:** Steps 10-13. The robot precisely places the pudding in the basket and releases its grip. This is the final action required to successfully complete the task.
