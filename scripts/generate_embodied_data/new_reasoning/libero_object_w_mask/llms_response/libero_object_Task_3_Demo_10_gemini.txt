## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up the BBQ sauce bottle from the table and place it in the basket. The environment contains a table with various items: BBQ sauce, a basket, chocolate pudding, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup, and cream cheese.  The initial state shows the BBQ sauce bottle on the table, and the basket is also on the table. The goal is to move the BBQ sauce bottle from its initial location to inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needs to navigate to the BBQ sauce bottle. This involves moving towards the general area where the BBQ sauce is located.

2. **Pick up BBQ Sauce:** (Steps 7-8)  The robot needs to grasp the BBQ sauce bottle using its gripper.

3. **Lift and Move to Basket:** (Steps 10-12) The robot needs to lift the BBQ sauce bottle and move it towards the basket.

4. **Place BBQ Sauce in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot needs to precisely position the BBQ sauce bottle inside the basket and release its grip.

5. **Return to resting position:** (Steps 18) The robot ends its task by moving to a stop location.
