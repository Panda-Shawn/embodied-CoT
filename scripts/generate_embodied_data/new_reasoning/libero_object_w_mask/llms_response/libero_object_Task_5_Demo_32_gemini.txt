## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a carton of tomato sauce from an unspecified location and placing it into a basket located on the floor.  The environment contained several other objects: milk and butter on a table, and orange juice and chocolate pudding cartons on the floor. The basket was on the floor. The tomato sauce's location is not explicitly stated but is implied to be reachable by the robot arm.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the tomato sauce:** This involved navigating to the general area where the tomato sauce was located. (Steps 1-4)
2. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** This included positioning the gripper above the sauce and grasping it. (Steps 4-8)
3. **Navigate to the basket:** This entailed moving the arm, while holding the sauce, to the basket's location. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This final stage involved releasing the sauce into the basket. (Steps 10-13)
