## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a container of alphabet soup from a table and placing it into a basket, also located on the table.  Other items were present on the table: salad dressing, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. Butter was located elsewhere. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the alphabet soup from its initial location to the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to the soup, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-3)  This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the soup container. This was necessary to position the arm for grasping.

2. **Grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 4-6) The robot needed to lower its gripper and close it around the soup container. This action secured the soup for transportation.

3. **Lift the alphabet soup:** (Steps 7-9)  The robot lifted the grasped soup container. This was necessary to clear the table and prepare for movement to the basket.

4. **Move to the basket:** (Steps 9-18) The arm moved the soup to the location of the basket. This involved moving in a direction away from the initial soup position and then toward the basket's position.

5. **Position above the basket:** (Steps 18-21) This involved fine adjustments to precisely position the soup above the basket. This is crucial for controlled placement.

6. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** (Steps 22-24) The robot lowered the soup into the basket. This involved opening the gripper to release the soup.
