## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a table and placing it in a basket.  The environment included a wooden surface (table or floor) with several objects: salad dressing, a basket, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing bottle was initially located on the table, and the basket was also positioned on the table.  The other items were scattered around. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the transfer of the salad dressing from its initial location to the basket. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the salad dressing within the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to move to a position where it could reach the salad dressing bottle.  This involved navigating around other objects on the table to avoid collisions and position itself directly above the salad dressing.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 5-6) The robot needed to close its gripper around the salad dressing to secure a firm grasp before lifting.

3. **Lift Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-8)  The robot needed to lift the salad dressing bottle from the table.

4. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-10) The robot needed to transport the grasped salad dressing bottle to the target location â€“ the basket. This involved movement while keeping the bottle secure.

5. **Position over Basket:** (Steps 10-11) The robot needed to carefully position itself directly above the basket to accurately place the salad dressing.

6. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 12-14) The robot needed to carefully lower the salad dressing bottle into the basket and release it.
