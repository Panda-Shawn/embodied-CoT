## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a container of cream cheese from a surface and placing it into a basket.  The cream cheese was presumably located on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was positioned at a different location. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese, grasp it securely, move it to the basket, and then release it.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-4. The robot moves towards the cream cheese, positioning itself for grasping. Justification:  The cream cheese needs to be within reach before it can be picked up.

2. **Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 4-6. The robot closes its gripper around the cream cheese. Justification:  Securing the cream cheese is necessary for successful transport.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-18. The robot moves from the cream cheese's location to the basket's location. Justification: This is essential to place the cream cheese in the basket.

4. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 18-23. The robot carefully positions and releases the cream cheese into the basket. Justification: This is the final goal of the task, placing the cream cheese in the basket.
