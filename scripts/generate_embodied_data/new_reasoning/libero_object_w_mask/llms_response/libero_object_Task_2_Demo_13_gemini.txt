## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of salad dressing from a table and placing it in a nearby wicker basket.  The environment included a wooden floor, a white wicker basket, salad dressing, ketchup, alphabet soup, cream cheese, milk, and tomato sauce. The salad dressing and ketchup were initially close to the basket, while the other items were situated around them. The primary activity was manipulation â€“ specifically, grasping and transporting the salad dressing bottle. The intended outcome was the successful relocation of the salad dressing into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Salad Dressing:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needs to navigate to the location of the salad dressing bottle. This involves maneuvering around other objects on the table to reach the desired object.

2. **Grasp Salad Dressing:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needs to securely grasp the salad dressing bottle using its gripper. This requires positioning the gripper correctly and closing it around the bottle.

3. **Move to Basket:** (Steps 8-13) The robot needs to transport the grasped salad dressing to the basket. This involves careful movement to avoid dropping the bottle and accurately positioning the bottle above the basket.

4. **Place Salad Dressing in Basket:** (Steps 13-16) The robot needs to carefully release the salad dressing into the basket. This involves opening the gripper and ensuring the bottle is placed without tilting or falling out.
