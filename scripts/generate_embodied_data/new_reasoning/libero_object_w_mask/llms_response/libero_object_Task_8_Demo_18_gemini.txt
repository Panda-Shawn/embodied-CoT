## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a bottle of chocolate pudding from a cluttered floor and placing it in a basket located on the same floor.  The environment contained several bottles (chocolate pudding, orange juice, bbq sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, alphabet soup) scattered on the floor, and a basket also on the floor. The bottles were not obstructing each other significantly.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to navigate to the chocolate pudding bottle. This involved maneuvering around other objects on the floor to reach its target.

2. **Grasp Chocolate Pudding:** (Steps 5-7) The robot needed to position its gripper above the chocolate pudding and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and Transport to Basket:** (Steps 8-12)  The robot had to lift the grasped pudding and move it towards the basket.  This involved careful maneuvering to avoid collisions with other objects.

4. **Place Chocolate Pudding in Basket:** (Steps 13-17) The robot needed to precisely position the pudding bottle above the basket and release it.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 18-20) The robot needed to move away from the basket to avoid accidental disturbances.
