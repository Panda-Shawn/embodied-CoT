## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box into a basket located on a table.  The cream cheese box and alphabet soup were situated near each other on the table, alongside other items (tomato sauce and ketchup). The basket was also on the table. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, requiring the robot to grasp each object individually, transport it to the basket, and release it.  The intended outcome was the successful deposition of both objects inside the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot was:

1. **Pick up alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-18)  The robot approaches, grasps, and lifts the alphabet soup.
2. **Place alphabet soup in basket:** (Steps 19-37) The robot moves the alphabet soup to the basket and releases it.
3. **Pick up cream cheese box:** (Steps 19-28) The robot approaches, grasps, and lifts the cream cheese box.
4. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** (Steps 29-39) The robot moves the cream cheese box to the basket and releases it.
