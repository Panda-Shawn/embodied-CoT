## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and moka pot to achieve the desired state: the moka pot sitting on the activated stove. The objects involved were a flat stove, a moka pot, and a chefmate frypan (which was irrelevant to the task). Initially, the moka pot was already on the stove, and the stove was off. The frypan was present on the table but played no role in the robot's actions.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Turn on Stove:**  (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to approach the stove and activate it. This involved moving into position to interact with the stove's controls.

2. **Lift and Move Moka Pot:** (Steps 8-11 and 12-21) The robot needed to safely lift the moka pot from the stove, to ensure it's in a stable position suitable for repositioning.

3. **Reposition Moka Pot:** (Steps 22-29) The robot needed to reposition the moka pot (after removing it from stove), possibly to ensure correct placement on the stove. This is less likely based on the trajectory however it's included to address potential variations in optimal policy execution.

4. **Place Moka Pot on Stove:** (Steps 30-31) The robot placed the moka pot back onto the stove after manipulating it.
