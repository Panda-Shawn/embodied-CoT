## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a cream cheese box and a stick of butter from a wooden table and placing them both into a nearby basket.  The cream cheese box and butter were located next to each other on the table, and the basket was also situated on the table. The robot needed to navigate to each item, grasp it, lift it, move it to the basket, and place it inside the basket before repeating the process for the second item. The general sequence involved approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, moving it to the basket, releasing it, then repeating the process for the butter.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** Steps 1-15. This involved navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Steps 16-34.  This involved moving the grasped cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it.
3. **Pick up the butter:** Steps 16-24. This involved navigating to the butter, grasping it, and lifting it.
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** Steps 25-34.  This involved moving the grasped butter to the basket and releasing it.
