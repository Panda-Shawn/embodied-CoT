## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was positioned at some distance from the table. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and grasping capabilities. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** This involved moving the robotic arm towards the book's location on the table.  (Steps 1-4)
2. **Pick up the book:** This encompassed the actions necessary to grasp and lift the book. (Steps 5-8)
3. **Move towards the caddy:**  The arm needed to navigate from the table to the caddy’s location. (Steps 9-16)
4. **Place the book in the caddy:** This phase involved positioning the book above the caddy’s back compartment and releasing the grip. (Steps 17-24)
