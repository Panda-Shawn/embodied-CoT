## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially located on the stove, but the robot needed to interact with it (likely to ensure it was correctly positioned or to verify its presence). The stove was on a table, along with a chefmate frypan. The robot's high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the moka pot.  This involved navigating around the environment to avoid collisions with the frypan and potentially the stove itself.

2. **Lift and Relocate Moka Pot:** (Steps 8-17) After grasping the moka pot, the robot needed to lift it slightly and move it away from its initial position on the stove, perhaps to better ensure stability or allow access to the stove controls.

3. **Turn on Stove (Implicit):** (Steps 18-24)  While not explicitly stated in the primitive movements, the trajectory suggests this step involved the robot manipulating the stove's controls. The movements suggest a rotation and approach towards the stoveâ€™s controls.

4. **Return and Place Moka Pot:** (Steps 25-30) The robot returns to the stove's surface and positions the moka pot. This involved careful positioning to ensure stability and proper contact with the stove's heating element.

5. **Release and Retreat:** (Steps 31-38) The robot releases the moka pot onto the stove and moves away to a safe distance.
