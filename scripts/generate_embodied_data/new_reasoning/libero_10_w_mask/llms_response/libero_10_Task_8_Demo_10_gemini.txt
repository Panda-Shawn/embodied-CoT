## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (floor or table), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to grasp each moka pot individually, lift it, and then place it on the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots positioned securely on the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the first moka pot:** (Steps 0-10)  This involved moving the arm to the location of the first pot and closing the gripper to secure it.

2. **Move the first moka pot to the stove and place it:** (Steps 11-18) This involved transporting the pot to the stove and releasing it.

3. **Approach and grasp the second moka pot:** (Steps 19-27) This was similar to step 1, but for the second pot.

4. **Move the second moka pot to the stove and place it:** (Steps 28-38) Similar to step 2, but for the second pot.

5. **Stop:** (Step 39) The task is completed.
