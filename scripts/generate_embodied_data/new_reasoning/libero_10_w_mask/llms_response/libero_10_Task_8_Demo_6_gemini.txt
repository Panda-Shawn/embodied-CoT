## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially situated on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was the manipulation and transportation of the moka pots from their initial locations to the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots positioned on the stove's surface. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching each moka pot, picking it up, moving it to the stove, and placing it down.  This process was then repeated for the second moka pot.


High-level movements identified:

1. **Approach and pick up the first moka pot:** Steps 1-11. This was necessary to acquire the first moka pot before any movement toward the stove could occur.  The robot needed to maneuver into a position to grasp the pot.

2. **Move the first moka pot to the stove:** Steps 12-20. After acquiring the first moka pot, the robot needed to transport it to the stove's location.

3. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** Steps 21-20. This involved carefully positioning and releasing the first pot onto the stove's surface.

4. **Approach and pick up the second moka pot:** Steps 21-31. This replicated the process used for the first pot; the robot approached and grasped the second pot.

5. **Move the second moka pot to the stove:** Steps 32-36. The second pot was then moved towards the stove.

6. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** Steps 36-38. This completed the task by placing the second pot on the stove.
