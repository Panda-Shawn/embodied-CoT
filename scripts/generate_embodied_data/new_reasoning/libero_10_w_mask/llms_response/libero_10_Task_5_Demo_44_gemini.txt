## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was positioned some distance away, presumably to the right and behind the book. The primary activity was manipulation of the book; the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddyâ€™s back compartment.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the book:** Steps 1-9. The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could grasp the book.  This involved moving forward, adjusting its orientation, and descending to the book's level.

2. **Grasp the book:** Steps 7-9.  This involved maneuvering the gripper to precisely above the book and then closing the gripper to secure it.

3. **Lift and move to caddy:** Steps 11-17. The robot needed to lift the grasped book and move it towards the caddy. This involved ascending, moving rightward, and potentially adjusting orientation to prepare for placement.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** Steps 18-24. The robot needed to accurately place the book into the caddy's back compartment. This involved carefully moving the book and then opening the gripper after placement.
