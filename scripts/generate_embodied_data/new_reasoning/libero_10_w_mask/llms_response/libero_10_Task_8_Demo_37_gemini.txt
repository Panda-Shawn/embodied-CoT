## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), and the stove was also on the same surface. The robot needed to grasp each moka pot individually, lift it, and carefully position it on the stove. This required a sequence of movements that involved approaching each pot, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the stove, positioning it, releasing the grip, and then repeating the process for the second pot.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** Steps 0-20.  This involved approaching the first pot, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** Steps 21-42. This involved moving the grasped pot to the stove and placing it down.
3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** Steps 21-42. This was already done during the same sequence of actions for the first pot.
4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** Steps 21-42. This involved moving the grasped pot to the stove and placing it down.

Note that steps 21-42 appear to handle both pots simultaneously.  The exact order of operations within this phase needs to be inferred from the fine-grained movements.
