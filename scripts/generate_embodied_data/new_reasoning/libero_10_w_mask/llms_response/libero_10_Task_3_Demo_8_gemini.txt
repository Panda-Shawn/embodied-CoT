## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a black bowl into the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The objects involved were a black bowl, a wine bottle, a white cabinet with a bottom drawer, and a wine rack.  The bowl was initially located on a surface (table or floor), the cabinet was on the table, the wine bottle was on the table, and the wine rack was on the table as well. The high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal were:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** The robot needed to navigate to the location of the black bowl, accurately locate it, and then grasp it using its gripper.  (Steps 1-11)
2. **Place the Bowl in the Drawer:** After grasping the bowl, the robot had to move to the cabinet, open the bottom drawer (implicitly), and carefully place the bowl inside. (Steps 12-20)
3. **Close the Drawer:** Once the bowl was safely inside the drawer, the robot needed to close the drawer. (Steps 21-36)
