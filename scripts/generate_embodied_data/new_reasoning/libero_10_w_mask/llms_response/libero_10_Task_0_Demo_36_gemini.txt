## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their initial locations to a designated basket.  The alphabet soup was already inside the basket, and the tomato sauce was positioned next to the basket on a table. Other items (cream cheese, ketchup, orange juice, milk, and butter) were also present on the table, but were not involved in the task.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being both items placed in the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** The robot needed to grasp the tomato sauce container.
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** After picking up the tomato sauce, it had to move it to the basket and release it.
3. **(Implicit) Check for completion:** The robot implicitly verified both items were in the basket.

**High-Level Movements:**

| High-Level Movement       | Step Range | Justification                                                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up the tomato sauce | 11-15       | The robot initially positions itself above the tomato sauce to grasp it.          |
| Place tomato sauce in basket | 16-44      | The robot moves the tomato sauce to the basket, releases it, and then completes a final check. |
