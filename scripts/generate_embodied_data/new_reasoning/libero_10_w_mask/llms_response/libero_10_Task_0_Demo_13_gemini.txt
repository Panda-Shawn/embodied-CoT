## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their initial locations to a basket.  The basket was located on a table or wooden surface, along with several other objects: a milk carton, orange juice carton, butter box, cream cheese, and ketchup bottle.  The alphabet soup was already in the basket, while the tomato sauce's location is not explicitly stated, but it is implied to be elsewhere on the table based on the robotâ€™s movements. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: 1) picking up the tomato sauce, 2) placing the tomato sauce in the basket, and 3) stopping.


The following table outlines the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:


| High-Level Movement | Trajectory Steps | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Pick up tomato sauce | 0-11 | The robot needs to approach and grasp the tomato sauce. |
| Place tomato sauce in basket | 12-30 | The robot needs to move the grasped tomato sauce to the basket and release it. |
| Stop | 31 | The task is complete. |
