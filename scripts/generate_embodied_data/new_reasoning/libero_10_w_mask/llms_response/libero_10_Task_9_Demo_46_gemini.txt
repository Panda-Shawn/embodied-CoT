## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a specific mug (yellow and white) from a table and placing it inside a microwave before closing the microwave door.  The environment contained a yellow and white mug, a porcelain mug, and a microwave. The yellow and white mug was positioned in front of the microwave on a table or wooden floor, while the porcelain mug was also on the table. The porcelain mug was irrelevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug (Steps 0-12):** The robot needed to navigate to the mug, orient itself correctly, and grasp the mug with its gripper.

2. **Move the Mug to the Microwave (Steps 13-19):**  After grasping the mug, the robot moved it towards the microwave.

3. **Place the Mug in the Microwave (Steps 20-26):**  The robot then carefully placed the mug inside the microwave.

4. **Close the Microwave (Steps 27-41):** Finally, the robot closed the microwave door.
