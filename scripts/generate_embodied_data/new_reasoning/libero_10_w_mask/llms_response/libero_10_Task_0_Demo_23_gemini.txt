## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their locations on a table to a basket, also on the table. The robot's environment included a basket, a milk carton, an orange juice carton, a butter box, cream cheese, a ketchup bottle (likely representing the tomato sauce), and a can of soup (representing the alphabet soup). The milk and orange juice cartons were together, the butter and cream cheese were together, and the ketchup and soup were together.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being both containers in the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** Steps 0-6.  This involved moving to the soup, grasping it, and then pausing.
2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 7-16. This involved moving to the basket and releasing the soup.
3. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 17-23. This involved moving to the ketchup, grasping it, and pausing.
4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 24-31. This involved moving to the basket and releasing the ketchup.
