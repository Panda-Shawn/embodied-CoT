## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a cream cheese box and a container of alphabet soup into a basket. The basket was located on the left side of a table, the cream cheese box was in the center, and the alphabet soup was on the right.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, requiring the robot to grasp each object individually, transport it to the basket, and release it. The intended outcome was to have both items successfully placed inside the basket.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Pick up Cream Cheese Box:** Steps 1-12.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese box, grasp it, and lift it. This is the initial action because cream cheese box is in the center and easily accessible.  The robot needs to get to it before attempting to reach the alphabet soup.
2. **Place Cream Cheese Box in Basket:** Steps 13-20. The robot had to move the cream cheese box to the basket and release it.  This step follows the previous pick-up. The robot must move to the basket to put the object down.
3. **Pick up Alphabet Soup:** Steps 21-28. The robot needed to navigate to the alphabet soup container, grasp it, and lift it.  The alphabet soup is next because after finishing with the cream cheese box, it's the only remaining objective.
4. **Place Alphabet Soup in Basket:** Steps 29-41. The robot had to move the alphabet soup to the basket and release it to complete the task. This is the final action, bringing both objects into the basket.
