## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The stove and moka pot were initially located on a table. The frypan was also present on the table, but not involved in the task. The robot needed to navigate to the moka pot, grasp it, and then move it to the stove and place it there.  This requires precise manipulation and avoidance of collisions.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach for and grasp the moka pot:** (Steps 0-4)  This involved navigating to the moka pot's location and securely grasping it with its gripper.

2. **Lift the moka pot:** (Steps 5-12) This involved lifting the grasped moka pot clear of the stove and the table's surface to avoid collisions.

3. **Move the moka pot to the stove:** (Steps 13-20) This involved moving the moka pot over to the stove.  This likely required careful planning of the path to avoid obstacles.

4. **Place the moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 21-27) This involved positioning the moka pot correctly on the stove and releasing it.

5. **Return to a resting position:** (Steps 28-36) The robot returns to a safe state after completing the task.
