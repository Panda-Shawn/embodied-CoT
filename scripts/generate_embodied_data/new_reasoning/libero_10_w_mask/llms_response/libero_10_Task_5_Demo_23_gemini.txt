## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy, also located on the table.  The book and caddy were both situated on the table alongside a white and yellow mug.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the book, requiring precise movements to grasp it without disturbing the mug. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-6) The robot needed to position itself appropriately to reach the book.  This involved navigating around the table and positioning its arm above the book.

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 7-10)  The robot had to move its gripper to the book and close it securely around the book.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 11-13)  Once the book was grasped, the robot needed to lift it clear of the table.

4. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 14-20)  The robot had to maneuver its arm, carrying the book, to the location of the caddy.

5. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 21-29) The robot had to precisely position the book within the back compartment of the caddy and then release its grip.
