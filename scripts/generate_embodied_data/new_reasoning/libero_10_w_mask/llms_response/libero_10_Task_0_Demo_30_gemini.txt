## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket. The basket was situated on a table, surrounded by other items including a milk carton, orange juice carton, ketchup bottle, butter box, and cream cheese.  The alphabet soup and tomato sauce were initially located on the table near these other items; their exact positions relative to each other and the basket are not explicitly specified. The task required a sequence of actions involving locating each item, grasping it, and transporting it to the basket, then releasing it.  The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory.


The high-level movements, inferred from the trajectory, are as follows:


1. **Reach for and grasp alphabet soup:** Steps 1-14. This movement was necessary to acquire the first item for placement in the basket.

2. **Place alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 15-23.  This movement was needed to deposit the first item into the target location.

3. **Reach for and grasp tomato sauce:** Steps 24-30. This step is necessary to retrieve the second item.

4. **Place tomato sauce in basket:** Steps 31-32. This final movement completes the task objective.
