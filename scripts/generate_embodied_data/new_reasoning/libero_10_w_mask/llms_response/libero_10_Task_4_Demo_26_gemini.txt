## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves manipulating two mugs and placing them on designated plates.  There's a white mug and a yellow and white mug. There are two plates, a left plate and a right plate. The goal is to put the white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate. The robot needs to navigate to each mug, grasp it, lift it, transport it to the correct plate, and carefully place it down. This requires precise movements and a well-defined sequence of actions to avoid collisions and ensure successful placement.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** (Steps 0-18) This involves approaching the white mug, grasping it securely, and lifting it clear of the surface.
2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** (Steps 19-30) This involves moving the grasped white mug to the left plate, orienting it appropriately, and gently placing it down.
3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** (Steps 31-36)  This involves repeating the pick-up process for the second mug.
4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** (Steps 37-38) This involves moving the grasped yellow and white mug to the right plate, orienting it appropriately, and gently placing it down.
