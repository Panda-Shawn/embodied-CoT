## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot on it.  Initially, the moka pot rests on a table next to the stove, which already has a chefmate frypan on it. The robot needs to pick up the moka pot, move it to the stove, and place it on the stove's surface.  The high-level movements needed to achieve this are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:**  (Steps 1-5) The robot must first navigate to the moka pot and grasp it securely with its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport Moka Pot:** (Steps 6-15) The robot lifts the moka pot from the table and transports it over to the stove.

3. **Position and Place Moka Pot:** (Steps 16-35) The robot positions the moka pot on the stove and releases its grip.

4. **Retreat:** (Steps 36) The robot retracts after successfully placing the moka pot.
