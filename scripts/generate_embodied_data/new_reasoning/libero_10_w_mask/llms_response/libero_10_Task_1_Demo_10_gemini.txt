## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially positioned next to the basket on the table. The robot needed to navigate to each item, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, placing it inside.  The robot's gripper needed to be precisely controlled to grasp each object without dropping it or damaging the objects or basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 0-8) The robot needed to move to a position where it could reach the cream cheese box and grasp it. This involves navigating to the cream cheese box, adjusting its orientation to properly grasp the box, and then closing its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese Box to Basket:** (Steps 9-18)  The robot needed to lift the cream cheese box, move it over the basket, and place it carefully inside.

3. **Approach and Grasp Butter:** (Steps 19-25) The robot needed to navigate to the butter, adjust its orientation and close its gripper to pick up the butter.

4. **Lift and Transport Butter to Basket:** (Steps 26-32) Similar to step 2, the robot needed to lift and place the butter into the basket.

5. **Post-Placement Adjustment (Optional):** (Steps 33-44) This stage likely involves a slight adjustment to ensure both items are securely in the basket, possibly adjusting the gripper and the arm position to settle the items.
