## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was initially located on the table, while a white and yellow mug was already present in the front compartment of the caddy. The back compartment was empty. The high-level movements required to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach the book:** The robot needed to navigate itself to a position where it could grasp the book.  This involves positioning the gripper above the book. (Steps 1-6)

2. **Grasp the book:** The robot needed to pick up the book using its gripper. (Steps 7-11)

3. **Lift and transport the book:** The robot needed to lift the book safely and move it to the caddy. (Steps 13-17)

4. **Approach the caddy (back compartment):** The robot needed to position itself above the back compartment of the caddy to deposit the book. (Steps 17-23)

5. **Place the book:** The robot had to carefully deposit the book into the back compartment of the caddy. (Steps 20-24)

6. **Return to initial pose:** The robot should ideally return to a neutral or resting pose. (Steps 25-26)
