## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving two moka pots from an unspecified location to the stove. The moka pots were initially separate and needed to be picked up individually. The stove was situated on a flat surface (floor or table). The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, requiring the robot arm to grasp each pot, lift it, and then carefully place it onto the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots positioned on the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** This involves approaching the first pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-14)
2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** This involves moving the grasped pot to the stove and releasing it. (Steps 15-19)
3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** This involves approaching the second pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 20-23)
4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** This involves moving the grasped pot to the stove and releasing it. (Steps 24-33)
5. **Stop:** The task is complete. (Step 34)
