## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a yellow and white mug from a counter to a microwave and close the microwave door.  The mug is located on a counter, the microwave is on the floor or table.  The environment also contains other objects (a gray counter, a wooden floor/table). The robot needs to navigate to the mug, grasp it, transport it to the microwave, place it inside, and then close the microwave door.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and grasp the mug:** Steps 0-11.  This involves moving the robotic arm towards the mug, adjusting its orientation and tilt to achieve a stable grasp, and closing the gripper to secure the mug.

2. **Transport the mug to the microwave:** Steps 12-19. This section focuses on moving the robot arm with the mug to the location of the microwave. It involves lifting the mug, navigating around any obstacles, and preparing for placement.

3. **Place the mug in the microwave:** Steps 20-31. This segment involves positioning the robotic arm so the mug is properly oriented and situated within the microwave.

4. **Close the microwave:** Steps 32-37. The robot closes the microwave door after successfully placing the mug inside.
