## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place two moka pots, initially located on a surface (table or floor), onto a stove, also situated on the same surface.  The primary activity is the transfer of the moka pots. The intended outcome is that both moka pots are safely and stably positioned on the stove.  The objects involved are two moka pots and a stove, all situated on a common surface.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** This involves approaching the pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-10)
2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** This involves moving the grasped pot to the stove's location and releasing it. (Steps 11-16)
3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** This mirrors the first step, involving approaching the second pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 17-24)
4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** This also mirrors the second step, involving moving the grasped second pot to the stove, ensuring both pots are on the stove, and releasing it. (Steps 25-35)
5. **Stop:** The task is complete. (Step 36)
