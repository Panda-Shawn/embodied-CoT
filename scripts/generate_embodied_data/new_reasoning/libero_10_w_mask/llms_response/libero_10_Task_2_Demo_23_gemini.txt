## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The environment consists of a wooden surface (table) with a chefmate frypan, a moka pot, and a flat stove. Initially, the moka pot is on the stove, and the frypan is on the table. The primary activity is manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot. The intended outcome is to have the moka pot safely and correctly positioned on the stove, ready for use.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach for and grasp the moka pot:** This involves navigating the arm to the moka pot's location, positioning the gripper, and securely grasping the handle. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Lift and move the moka pot:** This involves lifting the moka pot clear of the stove, and maneuvering it to a suitable position above the desired location on the stove. (Steps 5-11)
3. **Place the moka pot on the stove:** This phase involves carefully lowering the moka pot onto the stove's surface. (Steps 12-25)
4. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the stove and moka pot. (Steps 26-33)
