## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and a black Akita bowl inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet. The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, carefully remove it, and then close the drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needed to move towards the cabinet to reach a position where it could interact with the drawer.

2. **Open Drawer:** (Steps 8-17) This involved reaching the drawer handle, opening the drawer sufficiently to access the bowl inside, and stabilizing its position.

3. **Retrieve Bowl:** (Steps 18-24) This entailed grasping the bowl within the open drawer.

4. **Lift and Move Bowl:** (Steps 25-38) This involved lifting the bowl out of the drawer, moving it to a safe location away from the cabinet, and preparing for the final action.

5. **Close Drawer:** (Steps 25-38) The robot returned to the cabinet and closed the drawer.
