## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a can of alphabet soup and a cream cheese box into a basket.  Initially, the alphabet soup and cream cheese box were located on a surface, likely a table or counter,  at different positions. The basket was presumably positioned in a reachable area. The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket. This process was repeated for both items. The general sequence of high-level movements included: approaching the alphabet soup, grasping the alphabet soup, moving the alphabet soup to the basket, releasing the alphabet soup into the basket, approaching the cream cheese box, grasping the cream cheese box, moving the cream cheese box to the basket, releasing the cream cheese box into the basket, and finally stopping.


High-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

1. **Approach and grasp alphabet soup:** Steps 1-17. This was necessary to acquire the first object for placement in the basket. The robot needed to maneuver its arm to the soup can, adjust its orientation for a secure grip, and close its gripper.

2. **Place alphabet soup in basket:** Steps 18-33.  After grasping the soup can, the robot needed to move it to the basket's location, carefully position it, and then release it.

3. **Approach and grasp cream cheese box:** Steps 34-46. Similar to the first object, the robot had to navigate, orient itself correctly for the box, grasp the box, and then get ready for the placement phase.

4. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 47-48. Finally, the robot places the second object into the basket.
