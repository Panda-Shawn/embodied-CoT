## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The robot needed to pick up each moka pot individually, navigate to the stove, and place it on the stove's surface. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Picking up the first moka pot:** This included approaching the first pot, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Placing the first moka pot on the stove:** This involved moving the grasped pot to the stove's location and carefully placing it down.
3. **Picking up the second moka pot:**  This repeated the process of approaching, grasping, and lifting, but now for the second pot.
4. **Placing the second moka pot on the stove:** This involved moving the second grasped pot to the stove and placing it down next to the first pot.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up first moka pot         | 1-13        | To begin the task, the robot must first grasp the first moka pot.                   |
| Place first moka pot on stove   | 14-20       | To achieve the goal of placing the moka pots on the stove, the robot must move the grasped pot to the stove. |
| Pick up second moka pot        | 21-32       | The second moka pot must also be grasped before it can be placed on the stove.           |
| Place second moka pot on stove  | 33-41       | The second moka pot needs to be placed on the stove next to the first pot to complete the task. |
