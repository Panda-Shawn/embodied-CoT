## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table alongside a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was positioned some distance away. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the book:** The robot needed to navigate to the location of the book on the table. This involved a series of movements to position itself appropriately for grasping. (Steps 1-5)

2. **Grasp the book:** Once positioned, the robot needed to carefully lower its gripper to grasp the book. (Steps 6-10)

3. **Lift and move the book:** After securing the book, the robot needed to lift it and transport it to the caddy. (Steps 12-16)

4. **Approach the caddy:** The robot needed to navigate to the location of the caddy and position itself to place the book in the back compartment. (Steps 17-20)

5. **Place the book in the caddy:**  The robot needed to carefully lower the book into the caddy's back compartment. (Steps 22-24)
