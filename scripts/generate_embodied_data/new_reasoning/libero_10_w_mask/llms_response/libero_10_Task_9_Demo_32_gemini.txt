## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a specific yellow and white mug into a microwave and closing the microwave door.  The environment contained a yellow and white mug, a white mug, a microwave, and a wooden table. Initially, the yellow and white mug was on the table near the microwave. The white mug was also on the table. The goal was to pick up only the yellow and white mug, place it inside the microwave, and then close the microwave door.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the yellow and white mug:** (Steps 0-13)  This involved navigating to the mug, adjusting orientation, and grasping it securely.
2. **Place the mug in the microwave:** (Steps 14-20) This involved moving the arm with the mug to the microwave's opening and carefully placing it inside.
3. **Close the microwave door:** (Steps 21-40) This involved maneuvering the arm to reach the microwave door handle and closing it.
