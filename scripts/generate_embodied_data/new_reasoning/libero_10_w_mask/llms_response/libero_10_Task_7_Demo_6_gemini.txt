## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a can of alphabet soup and a cream cheese box into a basket.  Initially, the alphabet soup was located to the robot's right and slightly forward, while the cream cheese box was situated to the robot's right and further back. The basket was presumably in front of the robot, within reach.  The robot needed to grasp each item individually, lift it, and transport it to the basket before releasing it.  The general sequence involved reaching for the alphabet soup, picking it up, placing it in the basket, then repeating the process for the cream cheese box.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** Steps 0-15. This involved moving to the soup, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 16-30. This involved moving the soup to the basket and releasing it.
3. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** Steps 17-22. This involved moving to the cream cheese box, grasping it and lifting it.
4. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Steps 23-31.  This involved moving the cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it.
