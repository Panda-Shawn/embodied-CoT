## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a specific mug (the yellow and white one) from a table, placing it inside a microwave, and then closing the microwave door.  The relevant objects were a yellow and white mug, a porcelain mug, and a microwave. The yellow and white mug was located on a surface (table or floor) in front of the microwave, while the porcelain mug was also on the same surface.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the yellow and white mug, grasping it, moving it to the microwave, placing it inside, and finally closing the microwave door.


The robot likely followed this plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Yellow and White Mug:** (Steps 0-8)  The robot needed to navigate to the mug's location and pick it up.  This involved maneuvering around potential obstacles and precisely positioning its gripper for a secure grasp.

2. **Transport Mug to Microwave:** (Steps 9-12) Once the mug was grasped, the robot needed to transport it to the microwave opening without dropping it or colliding with anything. This required careful movement and maintaining a stable grip.

3. **Place Mug in Microwave:** (Steps 13-16) The robot needed to insert the mug into the microwave opening. This requires precise positioning and controlled movement.

4. **Close Microwave Door:** (Steps 17-34) The robot needed to close the microwave door after placing the mug inside.
