## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their initial locations to a designated basket. The basket was positioned on a table, along with several other food items: cream cheese, ketchup, orange juice, milk, and butter. The cream cheese and tomato sauce were located next to the basket, while the other items were arranged sequentially next to each other.  The alphabet soup was already inside the basket. The primary activity was to pick up the tomato sauce, move it to the basket, and place it inside.  The intended outcome was to have both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** (Steps 1-9) The robot moves to the tomato sauce, positions its gripper, and grasps the sauce container.
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 10-24) The robot moves the tomato sauce to the basket, positions it, and releases the gripper.
3. **Stop:** (Steps 25-39) The robot completes the task.
