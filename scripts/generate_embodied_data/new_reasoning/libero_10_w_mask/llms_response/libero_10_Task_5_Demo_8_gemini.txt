## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was situated nearby. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and grasp the book:**  This involves moving the robotic arm towards the book, positioning it for grasping, and closing the gripper to secure the book.  This covers steps 1-9 of the trajectory.

2. **Lift and move the book above the caddy:** This phase involves lifting the grasped book to a safe height above the table before transferring it to the caddy. This involves steps 11-13 of the trajectory.

3. **Navigate to the caddy's back compartment:**  The robot moves the book towards the caddy's back compartment, positioning the book for placement. This involves trajectory steps 14-16 and 21-22.

4. **Place the book in the back compartment:** The arm lowers the book to the correct position in the back compartment and opens the gripper. This part involves trajectory steps 17-20, 23-24.
