## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket.  The robot's environment included a basket situated on a table, along with several other items: a milk carton, orange juice carton (near the basket), a ketchup bottle (next to the milk carton), a butter wrapper, cream cheese (already in the basket), and the target objects: tomato sauce (initially in the basket) and alphabet soup (on the table).  The primary activity was the manipulation and transfer of the alphabet soup from its initial location on the table to the basket, leaving the tomato sauce undisturbed.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and grasp alphabet soup:** (Steps 1-17) The robot moves to the location of the alphabet soup, positions itself for gripping, and then grasps the soup container.  This is necessary to begin the transfer process.

2. **Lift and transport alphabet soup to basket:** (Steps 18-21) The robot lifts the alphabet soup and moves it towards the basket. This moves the soup to be placed.

3. **Position and release alphabet soup in basket:** (Steps 22-36) The robot precisely positions the alphabet soup within the basket and then releases its grip. This completes the main task objective.

4. **Return to home position:** (Steps 37-39) The robot returns to a default position after completing the task. This is a standard procedure for post-task completion.
