## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was positioned behind the book. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:**  (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to navigate to a position above the book, preparing for grasping.  This involved moving around the mug and positioning itself for optimal gripping.

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 8-10)  The robot needed to lower its gripper, grasp the book securely, and close its gripper.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 11-13) The robot needed to lift the book vertically to a safe height, clearing the table's surface.

4. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 14-17) The robot needed to move the grasped book towards the caddy.  This involves moving around obstacles and aligning itself correctly with the caddy's back compartment.

5. **Place the book:** (Steps 18-22) The robot needed to lower the book into the back compartment of the caddy.
