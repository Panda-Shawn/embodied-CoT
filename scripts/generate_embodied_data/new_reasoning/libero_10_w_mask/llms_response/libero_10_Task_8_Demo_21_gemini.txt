## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the moka pots and their transfer to the stove's surface. The intended outcome was two moka pots situated on the stove, ready for use. The objects involved were two moka pots, a stove, and a surface (floor or table) on which the stove rested. Initially, the moka pots were presumably located near the robot, separate from the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach for and grasp the first moka pot:** (Steps 0-9)  This involved moving towards the pot, adjusting orientation, and securing it with the gripper.

2. **Lift and place the first moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 10-16) This phase included lifting the pot, moving it over the stove, and then carefully positioning it on the stove's surface. The gripper was then released.

3. **Reach for and grasp the second moka pot:** (Steps 17-25) Similar to step 1, this involved approaching the second pot, orienting appropriately, and grasping it.

4. **Lift and place the second moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 26-33)  This step mirrored step 2, involving lifting, moving, placing, and releasing the second pot onto the stove.
