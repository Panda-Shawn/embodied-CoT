## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a specific mug—a yellow and white mug—into a microwave and then closing the microwave door.  The environment contained several objects: a yellow and white mug, a porcelain mug, and a microwave. The yellow and white mug was positioned in front of the microwave, while the porcelain mug was located elsewhere on the table or floor.  The high-level movements required were:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug (Steps 0-16):** The robot needed to navigate to the mug, adjust its orientation and position for a successful grip, and then grasp the mug securely. This involved a series of movements to approach the mug, accounting for its position and orientation.

2. **Transport the Mug to the Microwave (Steps 17-25):** Once the mug was grasped, the robot had to carefully transport it to the microwave, avoiding collisions. This phase involved a controlled movement to the microwave’s opening.

3. **Place the Mug in the Microwave (Steps 26-27):** The robot needed to precisely position the mug inside the microwave. This required opening the gripper to release the mug.

4. **Close the Microwave Door (Steps 28-49):**  Finally, the robot needed to close the microwave door. This involved a series of movements to reach the door handle and then close it.
