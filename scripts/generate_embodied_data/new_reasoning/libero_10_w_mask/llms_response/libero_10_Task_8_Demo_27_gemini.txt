## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), and the stove was also on the same surface. The robot needed to grasp each moka pot individually, lift it, and then carefully position it on the stove. The general sequence of high-level movements was to: 1) pick up the first moka pot, 2) place the first moka pot on the stove, 3) pick up the second moka pot, and 4) place the second moka pot on the stove.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** Steps 0-17. This movement involved approaching the first moka pot, grasping it with the gripper, and lifting it into a safe position above the surface.  This is crucial to prevent the pot from falling during manipulation.

2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** Steps 18-28.  This phase involved moving the grasped moka pot over to the stove, lowering it down, and then releasing it. Precision was necessary to avoid any damage.

3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** Steps 29-39. This was a repetition of the first picking-up movement, but with the second moka pot.

4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** Steps 40-40 (the action ends at step 40). This mirrored the placement of the first pot onto the stove, completing the task.
