## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it. The environment consists of a wooden surface (table) on which a chefmate frypan, a moka pot, and a flat stove are placed. The frypan is positioned away from the stove, while the moka pot is initially on the stove but needs to be repositioned perhaps. The robot needs to navigate to the stove, turn it on (presumably via a knob), and carefully place the moka pot correctly on the stove's heating element.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the stove's location.  *(Steps 0-2)*
2. **Grasp the moka pot:** This requires moving the arm to the moka pot, adjusting its orientation, closing the gripper, and then lifting the pot. *(Steps 3-5)*
3. **Turn on the stove:** This might involve rotating a knob on the stove to activate it. *(Steps 6-10)*
4. **Position the moka pot on the stove:** This involves moving the arm to the desired position on the stove and carefully placing the moka pot down. *(Steps 13-25)*
5. **Return to a resting position:** This might involve moving the arm away from the stove and into a safe resting state. *(Steps 27-38)*
