## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially positioned on a surface (table or floor), and the stove was also located on the same surface. The robot needed to grasp each pot individually, lift it, and then place it on the stove. The overall high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal were:

1. **Approach and Grasp the First Moka Pot:** This involves navigating to the first moka pot, lowering the robotic arm, closing the gripper to secure the pot, and then lifting it. (Steps 1-8)

2. **Move the First Moka Pot to the Stove and Place It:** This phase includes moving the grasped pot to the stove's location, positioning it correctly, opening the gripper to release it, and then returning the arm to a neutral position. (Steps 9-17)

3. **Approach and Grasp the Second Moka Pot:**  Similar to step 1, this involves navigating to the second moka pot, grasping it. (Steps 18-24)

4. **Move the Second Moka Pot to the Stove and Place It:** This stage involves moving the second pot to the stove, placing it correctly, and then retracting the arm. (Steps 25-36)
