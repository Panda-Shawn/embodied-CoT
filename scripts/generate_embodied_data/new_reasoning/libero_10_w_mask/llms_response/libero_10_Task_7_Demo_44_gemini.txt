## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a can of alphabet soup and a cream cheese box into a basket.  The initial state showed the soup and the box on a flat surface, presumably a table, with the basket some distance away.  The robot needed to pick up each item individually, navigate to the basket, and deposit the item inside. The general sequence involved: approaching the soup, grasping it, moving it to the basket, releasing it, then repeating the process for the cream cheese box.


High-level movements identified:

1. **Pick up alphabet soup:** Steps 0-16. This involved moving to the soup's location, grasping it, and lifting it clear of the surface.  This is necessary to acquire the first object for placement in the basket.

2. **Move alphabet soup to basket and place:** Steps 17-34. This involved navigating to the basket, positioning the soup above it, and then releasing the soup into the basket. This achieves the first part of the task instruction.

3. **Pick up cream cheese box:** Steps 35-36.  This is a partial high-level movement, as the step data ends here. It involves initiating the move towards the cream cheese box.
