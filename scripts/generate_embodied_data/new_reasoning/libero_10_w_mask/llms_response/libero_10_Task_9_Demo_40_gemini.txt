## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move the yellow and white mug from its location on a table to inside a microwave and then close the microwave door.  The environment contains a yellow and white mug, a porcelain mug, and a microwave. The yellow and white mug is initially positioned in front of the microwave, while the porcelain mug is also on the table.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug (Steps 0-15):**  The robot needs to navigate to the mug, position its gripper, and securely grasp the mug.

2. **Move the Mug to the Microwave (Steps 16-22):**  Once the mug is grasped, the robot must transport it to the microwave opening.

3. **Place the Mug in the Microwave (Steps 23-35):** The robot needs to carefully place the mug inside the microwave, ensuring it's stable and not tilted.

4. **Close the Microwave Door (Steps 36-51):**  After placing the mug, the robot must close the microwave door.
