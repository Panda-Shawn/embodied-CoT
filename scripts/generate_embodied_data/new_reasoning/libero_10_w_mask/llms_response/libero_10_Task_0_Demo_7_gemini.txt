## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from the table and placing them into a basket.  The basket was located on the table, with milk and orange juice cartons beside it, a ketchup bottle near the milk carton, a butter box next to the ketchup bottle, and cream cheese near the butter box. The alphabet soup's location is not explicitly stated but implicitly understood to be somewhere near the tomato sauce, given the task and the robot's movements. The primary activity was a two-stage manipulation process: picking up each item separately and placing it in the basket. The intended outcome was having both items safely inside the basket.

The high-level movements identified are as follows:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** Steps 0-14. This movement was necessary to acquire the first item for placement in the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to the alphabet soup's location, grasp it securely, and lift it clear of the table.

2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 15-16. The robot placed the alphabet soup in the basket.

3. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 17-32.  This was necessary to acquire the second item. Similar to the first item, the robot needed to navigate to the sauce, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 33-34. This completed the task by placing the second item in the basket.
