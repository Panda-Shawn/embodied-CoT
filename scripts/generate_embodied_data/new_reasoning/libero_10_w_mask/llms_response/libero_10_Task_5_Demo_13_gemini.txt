## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden surface and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was situated further back on the surface, presumably with a compartment at the rear.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-9)  The robot needed to navigate to the book's location to prepare for grasping. This involved moving towards the book, possibly avoiding the mug.

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 8-9) Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to grasp the book securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift and move the book:** (Steps 11-17) After grasping, the robot lifted the book and moved it to the caddy's location. This stage involved careful maneuvering to avoid obstacles and maintain a stable grip.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 19-23)  The final stage involved precisely positioning the book inside the caddy's back compartment and releasing it.
