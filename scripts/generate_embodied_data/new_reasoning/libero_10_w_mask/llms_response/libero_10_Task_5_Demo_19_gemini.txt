## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black book from a wooden table and place it in the back compartment of a desk caddy. The book is located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy is positioned behind the book on the table.  The primary activity is a two-stage manipulation: pick-and-place. The intended outcome is the book successfully transferred from the table to the back compartment of the caddy.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the book:** The robot needs to maneuver itself into a position where it can reach the book without colliding with other objects.  This involves moving towards the book, potentially adjusting its orientation for optimal grasping. (Steps 0-3)

2. **Grasp the book:** The robot needs to accurately position its gripper above the book and then close the gripper to securely hold the book. (Steps 4-6)

3. **Lift and move the book to the caddy:**  The robot needs to lift the book, avoiding collisions, and carefully move it to the caddy's location. (Steps 7-11)

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** The robot needs to position the book above the back compartment of the caddy and lower it gently into the compartment. (Steps 12-16)

5. **Retreat:** The robot needs to move away from the caddy to avoid any potential collisions and end the task (Step 17)
