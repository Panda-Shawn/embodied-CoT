## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was located some distance away from the book and the mug. The primary activity was the manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to navigate to the location of the book on the table. This involved maneuvering around any potential obstacles (implicitly, the mug) to reach a position suitable for grasping the book.

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 4-5) Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to grasp the book securely using its gripper.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 6-8) After successfully grasping the book, the robot had to lift it from the table's surface, ensuring a stable grip.

4. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 8-14) This involved moving the book across the environment to the position of the caddy, possibly needing rotations to orient itself appropriately.

5. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 14-18)  The robot needed to position the book in the back compartment of the caddy and release it. This involved precise positioning and releasing the gripper.
