## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The environment consisted of a flat stove, two moka pots, and a wooden surface (floor or table). Initially, the moka pots were likely positioned near the stove, but not directly on it. The robot needed to pick up each moka pot individually, transport it to the stove, and place it down carefully. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Approaching and picking up the first moka pot:** This involved moving towards the moka pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 0-11)

2. **Transporting the first moka pot to the stove and placing it down:** This involved moving the grasped moka pot to the stove's location and releasing it gently. (Steps 12-18)

3. **Approaching and picking up the second moka pot:** Similar to step 1, this involved approaching the second moka pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 19-25)

4. **Transporting the second moka pot to the stove and placing it down:** This involved moving the second grasped moka pot to the stove's location and carefully placing it down. (Steps 26-29)
