## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves retrieving a yellow and white mug from a counter, placing it inside a black microwave, and closing the microwave door. The objects are located on a wooden surface: a yellow and white mug and a black microwave are positioned next to each other, with the mug on a counter and the microwave adjacent to the counter.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Mug:** The robot needs to move towards the mug, position its gripper, and grasp the mug.
2. **Transport the Mug to the Microwave:** The robot must then lift the mug and carefully move it to the microwave's interior.
3. **Place the Mug in the Microwave:**  The robot places the mug inside the microwave.
4. **Close the Microwave:** Finally, the robot closes the microwave door.
5. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the microwave.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding steps:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and Grasp the Mug      | 0-10        | This involves navigating to the mug's location and carefully grasping it with the gripper.     |
| Transport the Mug to the Microwave | 11-24       | This phase consists of lifting the mug and moving it towards the microwave opening.             |
| Place the Mug in the Microwave   | 25-37       | This stage is about precisely positioning the mug inside the microwave.                         |
| Close the Microwave             | 38-40       | This involves reaching for and closing the microwave door.                                      |
| Retreat                         |  -           | This step is not explicitly defined in the trajectory provided. Assumed implicit in the ending action.|
