## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging three mugs on a table: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug.  The goal was to place the white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate. The initial state showed the white mug already on the left plate, but the yellow and white mug was likely on the table, not necessarily on the right plate, along with the red mug.  The high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal involved:

1. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the yellow and white mug's location, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 1-17)

2. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** This involved moving the arm to the right plate, precisely positioning the mug, and releasing it. (Steps 18-28)

3. **Pick up the red mug (if necessary):**  While the instruction doesn't explicitly mention the red mug, the trajectory suggests the robot may have moved it to make space for the yellow and white mug or to follow a learned optimal policy (Steps 29-36)


4. **(Optional) Return to home position or idle state:** Steps 37
