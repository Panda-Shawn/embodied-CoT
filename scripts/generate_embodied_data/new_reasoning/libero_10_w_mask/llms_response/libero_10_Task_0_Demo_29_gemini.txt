1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket located on a table.  Other objects present on the table included a milk carton, orange juice carton, butter box, and cream cheese. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully grasp each container and place them in the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot included:

1. **Reach for and grasp the alphabet soup:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the location of the alphabet soup, adjusting its gripper to securely grasp the container, and then lifting it.

2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the basket, carefully positioning the soup container, and releasing the gripper.

3. **Reach for and grasp the tomato sauce:** Similar to step 1, but targeting the tomato sauce instead.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:**  Similar to step 2, but placing the tomato sauce container.


The high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps are:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Reach for and grasp the alphabet soup (Steps 1-10):** The robot moved towards the alphabet soup, possibly navigating around other objects, and finally closed its gripper to secure the soup.  The initial movements are positioning movements to approach the soup.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Place the alphabet soup in the basket (Steps 11-14):** The robot moved the alphabet soup towards the basket and opened the gripper to deposit it.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Reach for and grasp the tomato sauce (Steps 15-21):** The robot repositioned itself to approach the tomato sauce and grasped it.  This included some tilting movement to aid in grasping.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Place the tomato sauce in the basket (Steps 22-33):** The robot moved the tomato sauce to the basket, possibly readjusting its orientation in the process, and released it.  Note this includes more complex adjustments (rotation and tilt) to ensure proper placement.

* **High-Level Movement 5: Final Positioning and Stop (Steps 34-37):**  The robot moved to a final neutral position.
