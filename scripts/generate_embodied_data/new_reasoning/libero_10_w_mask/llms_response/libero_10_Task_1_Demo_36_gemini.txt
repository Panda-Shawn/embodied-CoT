## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially located on the table near the basket. Other items were also present on the table. The primary activity was a two-stage pick-and-place operation: first picking up the cream cheese box, placing it in the basket, then picking up the butter and placing it in the same basket. The intended outcome was to have both items successfully deposited in the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, moving it to the basket, releasing it, then repeating the process for the butter.

The robot likely followed this plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese:** Steps 0-17. This involved navigating to the cream cheese box and securely grasping it with the gripper.
2. **Place Cream Cheese in Basket:** Steps 18-31. This stage focused on positioning the cream cheese box above the basket and carefully placing it inside.
3. **Approach and Grasp Butter:** Steps 31-38. This involved navigating to the butter and grasping it.
4. **Place Butter in Basket:** Steps 38-44.  This involved positioning the butter above the basket and carefully placing it inside.
