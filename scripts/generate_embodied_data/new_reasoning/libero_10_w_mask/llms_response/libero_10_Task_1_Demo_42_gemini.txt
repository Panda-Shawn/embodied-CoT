## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter and placing them into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and the butter were located next to each other on the table, in close proximity to the basket. The robot needed to execute a sequence of actions to grasp each item individually, ensuring it doesn't drop either item while moving to the basket, then place both items in the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely included:

1. **Approach and grasp the cream cheese box:** This involved moving the robot arm to the cream cheese box, orienting the gripper correctly, and closing the gripper to secure the box.

2. **Move cream cheese box to the basket and release:** This step involved moving the arm carrying the cream cheese box to the basket, positioning the box above the basket, and opening the gripper to release it into the basket.

3. **Approach and grasp the butter:** This involved repeating a similar approach and grasp sequence as for the cream cheese box, but this time targeting the butter.

4. **Move butter to the basket and release:** Similar to step 2, but now targeting the butter.

5. **Return to home position:** This likely involved the robot returning its arm to a default or safe resting position.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges based on the provided trajectory:

| High-Level Movement                     | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and grasp cream cheese box       | 1-18       | The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese box, orient its gripper, and grasp it securely.  The sequence of movements suggests this.       |
| Move cream cheese box to basket & release | 19-31      | The robot needs to carry the box to the basket, while avoiding collisions, before releasing it into the basket.                               |
| Approach and grasp butter                | 32-35      | Similar to step 1, this involves approaching the butter and securely grasping it.                                                            |
| Move butter to basket & release          | 36-37      | Similar to step 2, but for the butter.                                                                                                   |
