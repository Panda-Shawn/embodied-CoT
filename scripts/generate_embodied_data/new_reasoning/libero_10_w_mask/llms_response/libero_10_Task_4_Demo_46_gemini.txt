## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging two mugs on a table.  The environment contained three mugs: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug. The white mug was initially on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug was initially on the right plate. The task instruction was to leave the white mug on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate. This implies that the robot needed to perform no manipulation on these two mugs. The red mug's location is not specified in the task's instruction or relevant to the completion of the task. The goal was to ensure that the relative positions of the white mug and the yellow and white mug remained unchanged after the robot's actions.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** This involves moving to the white mug, grasping it, and lifting it slightly. (Steps 0-8)

2. **Place the white mug back down on the left plate:** This involves moving the arm to the left plate, releasing the mug, and returning to a neutral position. (Steps 9-17)

3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:**  Similar to step 1, but targeting the yellow and white mug on the right plate. (Steps 18-26)

4. **Place the yellow and white mug back down on the right plate:** Similar to step 2, but targeting the right plate. (Steps 27-37)
