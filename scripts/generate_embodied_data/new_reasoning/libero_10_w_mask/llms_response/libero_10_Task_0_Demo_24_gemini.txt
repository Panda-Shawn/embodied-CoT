## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket.  The robot operates in an environment containing a basket, milk carton, orange juice carton, butter box, cream cheese, ketchup bottle (assumed to be the tomato sauce), and a can of soup (assumed to be the alphabet soup). The basket is on a table, and the other items are situated around it on the table or floor. The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal involve:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** This involves navigating to the soup can, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 0-13)
2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** This involves moving the soup can to the basket's location and releasing it. (Steps 14-19)
3. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** This involves navigating to the ketchup bottle, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 16-26)
4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This involves moving the ketchup bottle to the basketâ€™s location and releasing it. (Steps 22-29)
