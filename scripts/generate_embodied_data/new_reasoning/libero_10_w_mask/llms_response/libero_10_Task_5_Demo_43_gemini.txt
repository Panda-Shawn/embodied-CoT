## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was positioned on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy, which had three compartments, was situated elsewhere in the environment. The primary activity was the manipulation of the book, requiring the robot to grasp the book and transport it to the specified location in the caddy. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the book into the back compartment of the caddy, demonstrating a completed pick-and-place operation.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to navigate to the location of the book on the table. This involved moving forward and adjusting its orientation to be positioned correctly over the book.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 8-9) Once positioned correctly above the book, the robot had to grasp the book using its gripper.

3. **Lift and move the book to the caddy:** (Steps 11-17) After securing the book, the robot needed to lift it, maneuver to the caddy's location, and position itself over the back compartment.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 18-28) The final stage involved positioning the book for placement and depositing it into the back compartment of the caddy. This included careful manipulation and possibly adjusting the orientation of the book and the gripper to ensure smooth placement.
