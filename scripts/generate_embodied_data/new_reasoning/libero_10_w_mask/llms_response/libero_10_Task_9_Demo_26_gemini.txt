## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a specific mug—the yellow and white one—into a black microwave and then closing the microwave door.  The environment contained three objects: the target yellow and white mug, a black microwave, and a black and silver mug.  The yellow and white mug was positioned in front of the microwave, while the black and silver mug was located elsewhere on the table or floor. The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve the goal included:

1. **Approaching and Grasping the Yellow and White Mug:** The robot needed to navigate to the mug's location, orient itself correctly, and grasp the mug securely.

2. **Moving the Mug to the Microwave:**  After grasping the mug, the robot had to transport it to the microwave's opening.

3. **Placing the Mug Inside the Microwave:** The robot needed to carefully position the mug inside the microwave.

4. **Closing the Microwave Door:** Finally, the robot had to close the microwave door.


High-level movements breakdown:

| High-Level Movement                 | Step Range | Justification                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching and Grasping the Mug     | 0-7        | The robot needs to get to the mug and pick it up.                                     |
| Moving the Mug to the Microwave     | 8-12       | The robot needs to carry the mug to the microwave.                                    |
| Placing the Mug Inside the Microwave | 13-19      |  The robot needs to carefully put the mug inside the microwave opening.                 |
| Closing the Microwave Door          | 20-34      |  The robot needs to close the microwave door.                                      |
