## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The environment included other items on the table (tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, and a carton of milk), but these were not involved in the task. The cream cheese box and the butter were initially located on the table, near the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to each item, grasp it, and move it into the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the cream cheese box, picking it up and placing it in the basket, then repeating the process for the butter.


The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Reach and grasp the cream cheese box:** Steps 0-10.  This movement was necessary to acquire the first object for placement in the basket.

2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Steps 11-20.  This movement is crucial to complete the first half of the task, moving the acquired item to its destination.

3. **Reach and grasp the butter:** Steps 21-28. This movement is necessary to acquire the second object for placement in the basket.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** Steps 29-39. This movement completes the second half of the task by placing the second item in the basket.
