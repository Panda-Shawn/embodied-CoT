## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially located next to each other on the table, near the basket. The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it, and then transport it to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the cream cheese box, picking it up, placing it in the basket, approaching the butter, picking it up, and placing it in the basket.

The identified high-level movements are:

1. **Approach and grasp cream cheese box:** Steps 0-10. This movement was necessary to acquire the first object, enabling the robot to proceed with the main task.

2. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 11-17.  This movement was required to deposit the first object into the designated location, fulfilling part of the task.

3. **Approach and grasp butter:** Steps 18-24.  Necessary to acquire the second object required for completing the task.

4. **Place butter in basket:** Steps 25-32.  This was required to deposit the second object into the basket, completing the task's core objective.

5. **Return to home position:** Steps 33-40. This movement ensures the robot is in a safe and consistent position after completing the task.
