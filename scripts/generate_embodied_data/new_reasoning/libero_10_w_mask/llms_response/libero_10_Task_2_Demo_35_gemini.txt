## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and the moka pot to achieve the desired configuration: the moka pot sitting securely on the heated stove. The objects involved were a chefmate frypan (irrelevant to the task), a moka pot (target object), and a flat stove (target object). Initially, the frypan was on the table, the moka pot was on the stove, and the stove was on the table.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Moka Pot:** This involves moving the robotic arm to the moka pot's location, positioning its gripper, and securely grasping the handle.  (Steps 1-7)
2. **Lift and Rotate the Moka Pot (if needed):** The robot might need to slightly lift and rotate the moka pot to ensure a better grip or optimal positioning for placement on the stove. (Steps 8-12)
3. **Move Moka Pot to Stove:** This involves carefully transporting the grasped moka pot to the stove's designated area. (Steps 13-22)
4. **Position and Place the Moka Pot:** This involves precisely positioning the moka pot above the stove's surface and gently placing it down. (Steps 23-27)
5. **Release the Moka Pot:** The robot releases its grip on the moka pot, leaving it on the stove. (Steps 28-34)
