### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to rearrange objects on a table: a white mug, a red mug (irrelevant to the task), a striped plate, and a chocolate pudding. The goal is to place the white mug onto the plate and the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  The initial state shows the white mug and pudding are not in their desired locations. The robot needs to pick up the white mug, place it on the plate, then pick up the pudding and place it to the right of the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** Steps 0-14. This involves moving to the mug, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the white mug on the plate:** Steps 15-22.  This involves moving the mug to the plate and releasing it.
3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** Steps 23-30. This involves moving to the pudding, grasping it, and lifting it.
4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** Steps 31-32. This involves moving the pudding to its desired location and releasing it.
