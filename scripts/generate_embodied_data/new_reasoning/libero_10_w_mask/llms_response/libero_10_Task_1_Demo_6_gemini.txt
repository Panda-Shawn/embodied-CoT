## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves placing both a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The initial state shows both items on the table, near but not inside the basket. The robot must navigate to each item, grasp it, lift it, and place it in the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Grasping the cream cheese box:** This involves moving the robotic arm to the cream cheese box's location, picking it up with the gripper, and moving it slightly upward to clear the table surface.
2. **Placing the cream cheese box in the basket:**  This involves moving the cream cheese box to the basket and placing it inside.
3. **Grasping the butter:** This involves moving the robotic arm to the butter's location, picking it up with the gripper, and moving it slightly upward to clear the table surface.
4. **Placing the butter in the basket:** This involves moving the butter to the basket and carefully placing it inside.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding steps in the trajectory:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grasping the cream cheese box  | 0-18       | To pick up the cream cheese box from the table.                                     |
| Placing cream cheese in basket   | 19-28      | To place the cream cheese box inside the basket.                                |
| Grasping the butter             | 29-42       | To pick up the butter from the table.                                           |
| Placing butter in the basket    | 43-45       | To carefully place the butter inside the basket.                                |
