## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was situated elsewhere in the environment, presumably off the table. The primary activity was a two-part manipulation: grasping the book and then depositing it into the target location. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from its initial position on the table to the back compartment of the caddy.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to navigate to the book's location on the table. This involved maneuvering around the environment until it was in a suitable position to pick up the book.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 8-10)  Once positioned correctly, the robot had to grasp the book securely using its gripper.

3. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 11-16)  After picking up the book, the robot had to navigate to the caddy's back compartment. This likely involved moving around potential obstacles and orienting itself appropriately for placement.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 17-24) The final step was to precisely place the book into the caddy's back compartment, requiring careful manipulation and potentially adjusting the robot's orientation.
