## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into the basket.  The basket is already on the table. The alphabet soup is initially inside the basket. The tomato sauce is located next to the cream cheese on the table. Other items (milk, butter, orange juice, cream cheese) are present on the table but are not involved in the task. The robot needs to pick up the tomato sauce, move it to the basket, and place it inside.  The high-level movements required are:

1. **Approach and grasp tomato sauce:**  (Steps 1-22) The robot needs to navigate to the tomato sauce, position its gripper, and grasp the container.
2. **Move tomato sauce to basket:** (Steps 23-34) The robot needs to lift the tomato sauce, move it to the basket, and carefully place it inside.
