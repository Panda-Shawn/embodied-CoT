## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The moka pot was initially located on the left side of a table, while the stove was in the center, and a chefmate frypan was on the right. The robot needed to navigate to the moka pot, grasp it, move it to the stove, and place it there.  The high-level movements likely followed are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needs to position itself to pick up the moka pot.

2. **Move Moka Pot to Stove:** (Steps 7-26) This stage involves lifting the moka pot and transporting it to the stove's location.

3. **Position and Place Moka Pot:** (Steps 27-36) The robot refines the moka pot's position above the stove and carefully places it down.
