## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging four mugs (one white, one yellow and white, one red) and two plates on a surface. The goal was to place the white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  Initially, the mugs were not in their desired locations.  The robot needed to pick up each mug, move it to its designated plate, and then place it down carefully.  The high-level movements likely involved the following:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Pick up the white mug from the right plate.** (Steps 0-21)  This was necessary because the white mug was initially incorrectly positioned on the right plate. The robot needed to retrieve it before placing it on the correct plate.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Place the white mug onto the left plate.** (Steps 22-44)  After picking up the white mug, the robot had to move it to the left plate and release it there.
