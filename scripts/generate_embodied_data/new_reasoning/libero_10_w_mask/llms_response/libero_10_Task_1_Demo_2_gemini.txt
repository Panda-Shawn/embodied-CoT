## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the cream cheese box and the butter from their location on a table into a nearby basket.  The basket, cream cheese box, and butter were all situated on a wooden table. The cream cheese box and butter were positioned next to each other. The primary activity was picking up each object individually and placing it in the basket. The intended outcome was to have both the cream cheese box and the butter inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** (Steps 0-19)  This involved navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and then lifting it.
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** (Steps 20-36) This involved moving the cream cheese box to the basket and carefully releasing it inside.
3. **Pick up the butter:** (Steps 20-28) This involved navigating to the butter, grasping it, and then lifting it.
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 29-38) This involved moving the butter to the basket and carefully releasing it inside.
5. **Stop:** (Steps 19, 38) This action indicates the conclusion of the high-level task.
