## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves manipulating two objects, a white mug and a chocolate pudding, to specific locations relative to a plate on a table. The initial state shows the white mug already on the plate, a red mug to the right of the plate, and the chocolate pudding on the floor. The primary activity is to reposition the objects according to the instruction: "put the white mug on the plate and put the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate".  The intended outcome is the white mug remaining on the plate (no change needed here) and the chocolate pudding positioned to the right of the plate.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and grasp the white mug:** (Steps 0-7).  This movement is necessary to ensure the robot is in a position to manipulate the mug, verifying its location and preparing for the next steps.

2. **Lift and reposition the white mug (no actual movement performed):** (Steps 8-17).  This step was included in the optimal policy likely to account for potential position adjustments, but the mug already being in place resulted in no physical movement.

3. **Approach and grasp the chocolate pudding:** (Steps 18-23). The robot needs to move to the pudding's location to pick it up.

4. **Lift and place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** (Steps 24-27). This is the final step to complete the task by placing the pudding in its designated location.
