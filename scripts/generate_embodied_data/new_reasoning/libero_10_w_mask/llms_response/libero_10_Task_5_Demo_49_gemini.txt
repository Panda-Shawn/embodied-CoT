## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a surface (floor or table) near a white and yellow mug and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy. The primary activity was object manipulation, with the intended outcome being the successful relocation of the book from its initial position to the caddy's back compartment.  The objects involved were: a black book, a white and yellow mug, and a desk caddy.  The book and mug were situated close to each other on a flat surface, while the caddy was positioned further away, specifically in its back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to navigate to the location of the book. This involved initial movement and adjustments to its orientation.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 6-8)  The robot had to position itself above the book, and then grasp it with its gripper.

3. **Lift and move to the caddy:** (Steps 9-14) The robot needed to lift the book, navigate around the mug (avoiding collision), and move towards the caddy.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 15-18)  Finally, the robot had to precisely position the book within the caddy's back compartment and release it.
