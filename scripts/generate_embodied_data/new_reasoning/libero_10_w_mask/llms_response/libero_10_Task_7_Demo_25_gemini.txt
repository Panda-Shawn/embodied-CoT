## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the cream cheese box and the alphabet soup into a basket situated on a wooden table.  Initially, the cream cheese box was next to the basket, and the alphabet soup was already inside the basket. The primary activity was to pick up the cream cheese box, place it in the basket, and then, if necessary (as it already was in the basket), confirm the alphabet soup was still in the basket.  The intended outcome was to have both items inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 0-8)  The robot needed to position itself correctly to pick up the cream cheese box.

2. **Place Cream Cheese Box in Basket:** (Steps 9-17) After grasping the box, the robot had to move it to the basket and release it.

3. **Approach and Verify Alphabet Soup (Redundant):** (Steps 18-29) This section seems redundant given the alphabet soup was already in the basket; however, the trajectory suggests a check was performed. The robot approached the location of the alphabet soup to verify it is still in the basket.

4. **(Redundant) Place Cream Cheese Box in Basket (Double Check):** (Steps 30-42) A possible double check on the Cream Cheese placement.
