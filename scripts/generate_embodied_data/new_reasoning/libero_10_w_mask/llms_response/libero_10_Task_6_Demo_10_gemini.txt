## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to rearrange objects on a table: a white mug, a red mug, and a chocolate pudding. The white mug is initially on a plate. The red mug is to the right of the plate. The chocolate pudding is on the floor. The goal is to move the white mug from the plate to the plate (no change in vertical position), and the chocolate pudding from the floor onto the table to the right of the plate. This requires the robot to pick up the white mug, ensuring the plate stays in place, then pick up the chocolate pudding, and place it next to the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:**  Steps 0-6.  This is necessary to move the white mug without disturbing the plate.  The white mug must be picked up before the pudding is moved to avoid collisions.

2. **Place the white mug on the plate:** Steps 7-13. This step ensures the white mug remains on the plate.

3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** Steps 14-22. This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to the pudding's location, picking it up and moving it above the floor.

4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** Steps 23-27. This involves positioning the pudding to the right of the plate.

5. **Stop:** Steps 28-29.  This is the final action after successfully completing all subtasks.
