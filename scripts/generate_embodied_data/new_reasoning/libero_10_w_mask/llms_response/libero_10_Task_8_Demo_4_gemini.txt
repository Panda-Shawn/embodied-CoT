## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving two moka pots from an unspecified location to a stove.  The environment contained two moka pots, a stove, and a surface (floor or table).  The initial state shows the moka pots are not on the stove. The intended outcome is to have both moka pots placed on the stove.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Reach and grasp the first moka pot:** This spans steps 0-16.  The robot needs to navigate to the first pot, grasp it securely, and lift it slightly to prepare for transport.

2. **Transport the first moka pot to the stove and place it:** This spans steps 17-26.  The robot moves the grasped pot to the stove and positions it appropriately before releasing it.

3. **Reach and grasp the second moka pot:** This spans steps 27-39.  The robot repeats the grasping process for the second pot.

4. **Transport the second moka pot to the stove and place it:** This spans steps 40-40. The robot moves the second grasped pot to the stove and positions it appropriately before releasing it, completing the task.
