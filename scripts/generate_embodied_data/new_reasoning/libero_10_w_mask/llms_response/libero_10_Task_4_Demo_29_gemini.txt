## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging two mugs on a table with two plates. The goal was to place a white mug onto the left plate and a yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  The initial state showed a white mug already on the left plate, a yellow and white mug already on the right plate, and a red mug as a distractor. The robot's primary activity was manipulation â€“ picking up and placing the mugs.  The objects involved were three mugs (white, yellow and white, and red) and two plates (left and right).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the yellow and white mug from the right plate:** (Steps 0-18)  This was necessary because the instruction specified rearranging this mug.

2. **Place the yellow and white mug back onto the right plate (potentially adjusting its position):** (Steps 18-34) This is inferred based on the final position in the task.  The step-by-step reasoning below will confirm this.

The step range for each high-level movement is inferred from the actions, and it does not imply actions were completely independent.  There might be small overlaps.
