## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a specific object, the Akita black bowl, from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment consisted of a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (middle), a wine bottle (right), and the target Akita black bowl inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet. All objects were situated on a wooden floor or table.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet to access the drawer.  (Steps 1-5)
2. **Open the drawer:** The robot needs to manipulate the drawer to open it and access the bowl. (Steps 6-8)
3. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot needs to pick up the black bowl from inside the drawer. (Steps 8-9)
4. **Lift the bowl out of the drawer:**  The robot needs to remove the bowl from the drawer. (Steps 10-12)
5. **Move the bowl to a safe location:**  This is a temporary holding location before putting it in the next destination. (Steps 12-14)
6. **Return to the drawer:** The robot needs to go back to the drawer area to put it away. (Steps 14-16)
7. **Put the bowl in the drawer:** The robot needs to place the bowl in the drawer. (Steps 16-17)
8. **Close the drawer:** The robot needs to close the drawer after placing the bowl inside. (Steps 18-28)
