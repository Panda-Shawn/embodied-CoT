## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to put both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into the basket.  The basket is located on a table or wooden floor, with the alphabet soup already inside. The tomato sauce is situated next to the basket on the table. Other items – cream cheese, ketchup, orange juice, milk, and butter – are also present on the table, but are irrelevant to the task. The robot needs to pick up the tomato sauce from its location beside the basket and place it into the basket.  The primary activity involves grasping and moving the tomato sauce. The intended outcome is to have both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Reach for and grasp the tomato sauce:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needs to position itself to pick up the tomato sauce.
2. **Lift the tomato sauce:** (Steps 7-9)  The robot lifts the tomato sauce after grasping it.
3. **Move the tomato sauce towards the basket:** (Steps 10-11) The robot moves the tomato sauce towards the basket.
4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 11-13) This involves releasing the tomato sauce into the basket.
5. **Reach for and grasp the tomato sauce (again, because the first pick-up failed):** (Steps 14-20)  The robot readjusts and attempts to pick up the tomato sauce again, likely due to a slight miscalculation in step 1.
6. **Lift and place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 21-28) The robot successfully lifts and places the tomato sauce into the basket this time.
