## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket.  The basket was already present on a table or wooden surface. The tomato sauce was initially inside the basket, while the alphabet soup was located elsewhere on the table amongst other items (milk carton, orange juice carton, butter box, and cream cheese). The robot needed to pick up the alphabet soup, avoiding the other items, and place it into the basket.  The high-level movements needed were:

1. **Approach and grasp alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-7) The robot needed to move to a position where it could safely grasp the alphabet soup without colliding with other items.

2. **Lift and transport alphabet soup:** (Steps 8-18) After grasping the alphabet soup, the robot had to carefully lift it and move it towards the basket.

3. **Place alphabet soup in basket:** (Steps 19-29)  Delicately place the alphabet soup into the basket.

4. **Approach and check tomato sauce (redundant):** (Steps 30-33)  It seems the robot performed an additional check on the tomato sauce, possibly to confirm it was still within the basket (this was already stated to be true in the beginning).

5. **Depart:** (Steps 34-43) The robot moved away from the basket, completing the task.
