## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place two moka pots onto a stove. The environment contains two moka pots and a stove situated on a flat surface (a table or floor).  The initial state shows the moka pots are not on the stove. The robot needs to pick up each pot individually, move it to the stove, and place it down. This involves a sequence of actions for each pot: approach, grasp, lift, transport, and place.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach and grasp the first moka pot** | 0-8 | The robot needs to get close enough to the first pot to grasp it.  Stopping at step 6 allows for sensor readings to confirm positioning.  Step 7 is the grasping action. |
| **Lift and transport the first moka pot to the stove** | 9-14 | Once grasped, the robot must lift the pot and move it to the stove's location. This includes positioning above the stove. |
| **Place the first moka pot on the stove** | 15-18 |  The pot needs to be carefully placed on the stove; releasing its grip is crucial. |
| **Approach and grasp the second moka pot** | 19-25 | The robot repeats the process for the second pot, approaching and grasping it. |
| **Lift and transport the second moka pot to the stove** | 26-30 | Similar to the first pot, the robot lifts and transports this one towards the stove. |
| **Place the second moka pot on the stove** | 31-36 | The second pot is placed onto the stove, completing the task. The robot might need to adjust its orientation. |
