## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The stove and moka pot were initially located on a table, with the moka pot already positioned on the stove. The frypan was also on the table, but irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot. The intended outcome was the moka pot securely placed on the turned-on stove.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove and moka pot:** (Steps 0-6)  This initial movement brought the robot arm into a position where it could interact with the stove and moka pot.  It was necessary to establish a safe and effective starting point for subsequent actions.

2. **Turn on the stove:** (Steps 7-10) This involved manipulating the stove's controls.  It was a critical step towards successfully completing the task, as the instruction required a turned-on stove.

3. **Grasp the moka pot:** (Steps 11-18)  This involved positioning the gripper above the moka pot and securely grasping it.  Gripping the pot was crucial for the subsequent lifting and placement.

4. **Lift and place the moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 19-24)  This involved carefully lifting the moka pot and then positioning it back down onto the stove. It finalized the main objective of the task.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 25-30) This final movement moved the robotic arm to a safe position away from the stove and moka pot, completing the task safely.
