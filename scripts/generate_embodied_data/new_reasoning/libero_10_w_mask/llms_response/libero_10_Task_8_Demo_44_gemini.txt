## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring two moka pots from an unspecified location to a stove. The primary activity was manipulation and placement, with the intended outcome being both moka pots safely and stably positioned on the stove. The objects involved were two moka pots and a stove, all situated on a flat surface (wooden floor or table).  The general sequence of high-level movements likely included:

1. **Approach and Grasp the First Moka Pot:** This involved navigating to the first pot, positioning the robotic arm, and securely grasping the pot with its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport the First Moka Pot to the Stove:** This involved lifting the grasped pot, moving it to the stove's location, and preparing for placement.

3. **Place the First Moka Pot on the Stove:** This involved carefully lowering the pot onto the stove in a stable manner and releasing it from the gripper.

4. **Approach and Grasp the Second Moka Pot:** This involved repeating the approach and grasping procedure for the second pot.

5. **Lift and Transport the Second Moka Pot to the Stove:**  This involved lifting the second grasped pot, moving it to the stove's location, and preparing for placement.

6. **Place the Second Moka Pot on the Stove:** This involved carefully lowering the second pot onto the stove in a stable manner and releasing it from the gripper.

7. **Return to a resting position:**  The robot returned to a safe state after completing the task.


High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:

| High-Level Movement                      | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and Grasp First Moka Pot       | 1-11       | The robot needs to position itself correctly to pick up the first pot, hence the initial movements of rotation and approach. |
| Lift and Transport First Moka Pot       | 12-20      | The robot needs to lift and carefully move the pot to avoid dropping it and to prepare it for placement.                              |
| Place First Moka Pot on the Stove       | 20-20      | Release the first pot on the stove after positioning.                                                                             |
| Approach and Grasp Second Moka Pot      | 21-26      | Repeating the approach and grasping for the second pot.                                                                        |
| Lift and Transport Second Moka Pot      | 27-37      | Lifting and moving the second pot to the stove.                                                                               |
| Place Second Moka Pot on the Stove       | 37-40      | Placing the second pot and releasing it.                                                                                     |
