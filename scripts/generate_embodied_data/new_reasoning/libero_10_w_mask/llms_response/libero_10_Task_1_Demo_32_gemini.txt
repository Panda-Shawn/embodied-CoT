## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter from a table and placing them into a basket located near some other items (milk and orange juice).  Other objects present on the table included alphabet soup, tomato sauce, and ketchup. The primary activity was a two-stage pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being both items correctly deposited in the basket. The cream cheese box and butter were initially situated on the table at some distance from the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 0-6) The robot moves to a position above the cream cheese box, preparing to grasp it.
2. **Pick up Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 6-16) The robot grasps the cream cheese box.
3. **Move Cream Cheese Box to a Staging Area:** (Steps 16-20) The robot moves the cream cheese box to a temporary holding position, to avoid interfering with the subsequent pickup of the butter.
4. **Approach Butter:** (Steps 18-25) The robot approaches the butter and prepares to pick it up.
5. **Pick up Butter:** (Steps 25-26) The robot grasps the butter.
6. **Place both in Basket:** (Steps 27-33) The robot moves to the basket and places both the cream cheese box and the butter inside.
