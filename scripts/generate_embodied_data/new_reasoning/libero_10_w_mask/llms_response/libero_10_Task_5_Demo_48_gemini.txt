## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was located some distance away. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was to have the book safely deposited in the caddy's back compartment.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** Steps 1-4. The robot needed to navigate to the book's location on the table. This involved positioning itself optimally for grasping.

2. **Pick up the book:** Steps 5-10. This involved lowering the robotic arm, closing the gripper around the book, and then lifting the book.

3. **Navigate to the caddy:** Steps 11-20. The robot had to move the book to the caddy while keeping it secure in its gripper. This stage included rotation to appropriately orient the book for placement.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** Steps 21-26. The robot positioned the arm and released the book into the back compartment of the caddy.
