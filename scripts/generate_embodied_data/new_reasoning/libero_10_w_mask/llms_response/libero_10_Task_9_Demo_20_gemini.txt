## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a yellow and white mug into a black microwave and closing the microwave door. The mug was initially located on a gray table, alongside the microwave.  The goal was to manipulate the robotic arm to pick up the mug, transport it to the microwave, place it inside, and then close the microwave door. The robot needed to navigate around the objects on the table to achieve this.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Mug:** (Steps 0-11) The robot needed to approach the mug, position its gripper, and grasp the mug securely. This involved navigating to the mug's location, adjusting its orientation, and closing the gripper.

2. **Transport Mug to Microwave:** (Steps 12-16)  After grasping the mug, the robot had to carefully lift and transport it to the microwave, avoiding collisions.

3. **Place Mug in Microwave:** (Steps 17-24) The robot needed to precisely position the mug inside the microwave. This required opening the gripper, positioning the arm over the microwave, and lowering the mug gently into the cavity.

4. **Close Microwave Door:** (Steps 25-34) Finally, the robot needed to close the microwave door.
