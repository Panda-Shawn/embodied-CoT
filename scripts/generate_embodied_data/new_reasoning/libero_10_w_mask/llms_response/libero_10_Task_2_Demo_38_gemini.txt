## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and moka pot to achieve the desired configuration. The objects involved were a moka pot, a flat stove, and a chefmate frypan (which is irrelevant to the task). Initially, the moka pot was positioned on the stove, and the stove was on a table. The frypan was also on the table. The robot needed to interact with the stove's controls (presumably a knob or switch) and then carefully place the moka pot onto the stove's heating surface without causing damage or spilling.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove and turn it on:** This involves navigating to the stove and manipulating its controls to activate it.  (Steps 0-7)
2. **Lift the moka pot:** The robot needs to grasp the moka pot to move it. (Steps 8-10)
3. **Move the moka pot above its target position on the stove:**  This ensures a controlled and safe placement. (Steps 11-17)
4. **Lower the moka pot onto the stove:** This completes the task of placing the moka pot on the heated stove. (Steps 18-25)
5. **Retreat:** The robot moves away from the stove. (Steps 26-33)
