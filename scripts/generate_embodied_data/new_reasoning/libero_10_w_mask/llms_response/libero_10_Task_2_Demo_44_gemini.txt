## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The environment consisted of a stove located on the left, a frying pan on the right, and a moka pot centrally positioned on a flat surface (table or counter). The primary activity was to manipulate the robot arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot. The intended outcome was to have the moka pot safely and correctly positioned on the stove's heating element, ready for use.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 0-6)  The robot needed to move to the moka pot's location and grasp it securely with its gripper. This involved initial positioning, movement towards the moka pot, and closing the gripper to secure its hold.

2. **Turn on the Stove:** (Steps 7-12)  After acquiring the moka pot, the robot had to locate and activate the stove's controls. This required precise movement and manipulation of the stove's controls, possibly involving rotation to engage the switch.

3. **Place Moka Pot on Stove:** (Steps 13-30)  With the stove on, the robot needed to accurately position the moka pot on the stove's heating element.  This would involve precise movement and careful placement to ensure stability and prevent damage to the pot or stove.

4. **Adjust and Finalize:** (Steps 31-39) The final step potentially included minor adjustments to the moka pot's position to ensure it was correctly seated on the stove and releasing the gripper for final position.
