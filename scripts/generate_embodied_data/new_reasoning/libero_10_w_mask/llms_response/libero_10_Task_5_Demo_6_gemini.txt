### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was positioned some distance away from the book. The primary activity was manipulation of the book; the intended outcome was the book's successful transfer to the caddy's back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:**  (Steps 0-2)  This involved moving the robotic arm into a position to grasp the book.  This is necessary to gain access to the object before attempting any manipulation.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 3-7)  This stage focused on grasping the book securely.  It required precise positioning and closure of the gripper.

3. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 8-12) The robot needed to transport the grasped book to the caddy’s back compartment. This involved a combination of translational and rotational movements.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 13-19) This final stage involved carefully positioning and releasing the book into the caddy's back compartment.
