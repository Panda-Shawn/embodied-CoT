## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating two mugs and placing them onto designated plates.  The environment contained a white mug, a yellow and white mug, a left plate, and a right plate. The goal was to place the white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  The robot needed to navigate to each mug, grasp it, lift it, move it to the correct plate, and release it.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching and grasping the white mug, moving it to the left plate, releasing it, approaching and grasping the yellow and white mug, moving it to the right plate, and releasing it.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp White Mug:** Steps 1-11. This movement was necessary to acquire the first object required for task completion.

2. **Move White Mug to Left Plate and Release:** Steps 12-17.  This involved transporting the grasped mug to its designated location and releasing it.

3. **Approach and Grasp Yellow and White Mug:** Steps 18-28. This was required to acquire the second object.

4. **Move Yellow and White Mug to Right Plate and Release:** Steps 29-38. This involved moving the second mug to its correct location and releasing it.

5. **Stop:** Steps 39. This concludes the task.
