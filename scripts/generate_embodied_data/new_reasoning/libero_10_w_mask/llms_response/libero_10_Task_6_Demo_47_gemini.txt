## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a table to achieve a specific arrangement. The primary activity was to reposition a white mug and a chocolate pudding relative to a plate. The intended outcome was to have the white mug on the plate and the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  The objects involved were a white mug, a plate, a chocolate pudding, and a red coffee mug (which is irrelevant to the task itself). Initially, the white mug was on the plate, the chocolate pudding was to the right of the white mug, and the red coffee mug was to the right of the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved moving the arm to the pudding, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 7-12)
2. **Move the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This involved moving the arm carrying the pudding to the desired location and placing it down. (Steps 15-25)
3. **Stop:**  The task is completed. (Steps 26-36, mostly repositioning and stopping movements)


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Pick up the chocolate pudding | 7-12 | The pudding needs to be moved, so the robot must first grasp it. |
| Move the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate | 15-25 | This is the main objective of the second half of the task; placing the pudding in its final location. |
| Stop | 26-36 | The task is complete; these steps likely represent the arm returning to its home position or a safe state. |
