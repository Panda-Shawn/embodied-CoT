## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a yellow and white mug into a black microwave and closing the microwave door. The environment contained the target mug (yellow and white), a black microwave, and a distractor mug (porcelain). The yellow and white mug was situated in front of the microwave on a table or floor. The porcelain mug was also on the table, but not relevant to the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug (Steps 0-12):** The robot needed to navigate to the mug's location, adjust its orientation for grasping, and then securely grasp the mug with its gripper.

2. **Place the Mug in the Microwave (Steps 13-19):** After grasping the mug, the robot had to move towards the microwave and carefully place the mug inside.

3. **Close the Microwave Door (Steps 20-35):**  The final step involved moving to a position to interact with the microwave door and closing it.
