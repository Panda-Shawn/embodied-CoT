## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table alongside a white and yellow mug. The caddy was positioned such that its back compartment was accessible, but not directly in front of the robot's starting position. The robot needed to navigate to the book, grasp it, and then navigate to the caddy's back compartment to deposit it.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move to a position where it could reach the book on the table. This involved maneuvering around the environment.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 6-11) This stage focused on lowering the gripper to grasp the book securely.

3. **Navigate to the caddy:** (Steps 12-20) After picking up the book, the robot needed to move to the caddy while keeping the book secure.  This likely involved avoiding obstacles and positioning itself appropriately for placement.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 21-25) This final stage involved precisely placing the book into the caddy's back compartment.
