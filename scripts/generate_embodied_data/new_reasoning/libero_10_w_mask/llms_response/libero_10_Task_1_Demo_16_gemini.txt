## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The initial state showed the cream cheese box and butter on the table, separate from the basket. Other items were also present on the table. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being both objects successfully deposited in the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: first picking up the cream cheese box, placing it in the basket; then picking up the butter, placing it in the basket.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Pick up cream cheese box:** Steps 1-16.  This movement was necessary to acquire the first object for placement in the basket.

2. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 17-27. This was needed to fulfill part of the task instruction by putting one of the two required items in the basket.

3. **Pick up butter:** Steps 19-24. This was necessary to acquire the second object for placement in the basket.

4. **Place butter in basket:** Steps 25-41. This completed the task by putting the second item into the basket.
