## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and an Akita black bowl located inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet. The primary activity was manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the goal of placing the black bowl in the desired location. The intended outcome was the black bowl being safely inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet, with the drawer closed.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the Cabinet         | 1-4        | To get close enough to the cabinet to reach the handle and drawer.                |
| Open the Cabinet Drawer      | 5-7        | To access the black bowl inside.                                                |
| Grasp the Black Bowl         | 8-12       | To securely hold the bowl for transportation.                                  |
| Lift the Bowl out of the Drawer | 13-17      | To remove the bowl from the drawer.                                            |
| Transport the Bowl to the Drawer | 18-27 | To move the bowl from its current position to the cabinet drawer.               |
| Place the Bowl in the Drawer   | 28-29     | To place the bowl in the desired location.                                     |
