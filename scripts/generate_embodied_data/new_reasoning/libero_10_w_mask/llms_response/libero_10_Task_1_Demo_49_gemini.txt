## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and the butter were initially located next to each other on the table. Other items, including tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, and milk, were also present on the table, but not directly relevant to the task. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation requiring the robot to grasp each item individually, lift it, and deposit it in the basket.  The intended outcome was to have both the cream cheese box and the butter safely inside the basket.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Pick up cream cheese box:** Steps 1-12. This involves navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it.

2. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 13-22. This involves moving the grasped cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it.

3. **Pick up butter:** Steps 23-36. This involves navigating to the butter, grasping it, and lifting it.

4. **Place butter in basket:** Steps 37-50. This involves moving the grasped butter to the basket and releasing it.
