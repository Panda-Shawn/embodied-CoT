## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their initial locations to a basket. The basket was situated on a table, along with several other food items: cream cheese (next to the basket), ketchup (next to the cream cheese), orange juice (next to the ketchup), milk (next to the orange juice), and butter (next to the milk).  The alphabet soup was already inside the basket. The tomato sauce was located next to the basket. The primary activity was manipulating the robot arm to pick up the tomato sauce, and place it in the basket.  The intended outcome was to have both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce inside the basket.

The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 0-18.  This involved positioning the gripper over the tomato sauce, grasping it, and then lifting it.
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 19-39. This involved moving the grasped tomato sauce to the basket and placing it inside.
3. **Stop:** Steps 40-41.  The task is completed.
