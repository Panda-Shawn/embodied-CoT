## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a yellow and white mug into a microwave and closing the microwave door.  The environment contained a yellow and white mug, a porcelain mug, and a microwave. The yellow and white mug was positioned in front of the microwave, while the porcelain mug was situated on a table or counter. The overall sequence of high-level movements can be summarized as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Mug:** The robot initially navigated to the yellow and white mug, adjusted its orientation, and grasped the mug using its gripper.  (Steps 0-18)

2. **Place Mug in Microwave:** The robot then carefully maneuvered the mug into the microwave opening. (Steps 19-38)

3. **Close Microwave Door:** Finally, the robot moved away from the microwave and closed its door. (Steps 39-61)


| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and Grasp Mug       | 0-18        | The robot needed to locate and securely grasp the target mug before proceeding with placement.       |
| Place Mug in Microwave       | 19-38       | This stage involved precise maneuvering to place the mug inside the microwave without obstruction. |
| Close Microwave Door         | 39-61       | The final step was to close the microwave door, completing the task as instructed.                 |
