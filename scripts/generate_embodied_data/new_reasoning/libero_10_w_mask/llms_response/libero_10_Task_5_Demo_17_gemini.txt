## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a black book located on a wooden table and place it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was positioned some distance away from the book, requiring the robot arm to navigate the workspace. The primary activity was manipulationâ€”grasping the book and transporting it to its destination. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from its initial position on the table to the back compartment of the caddy.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the Book:** Steps 0-4.  The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the book. This involved navigating around the table and positioning itself appropriately.

2. **Grasp the Book:** Steps 5-6. The robot needed to reach for and grasp the book with its gripper.

3. **Lift the Book:** Steps 7-9.  The robot had to lift the book from the table.

4. **Navigate to Caddy:** Steps 10-16. The robot needed to maneuver its way to the caddy's location, avoiding obstacles.

5. **Position over Caddy:** Steps 17-20. The robot had to position the book above the back compartment of the caddy.

6. **Place the Book:** Steps 20-21. The robot placed the book into the back compartment of the caddy.
