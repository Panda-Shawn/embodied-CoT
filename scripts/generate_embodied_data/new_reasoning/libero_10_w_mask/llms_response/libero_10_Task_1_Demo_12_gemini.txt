## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to place both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket.  The cream cheese box and the butter were located on a wooden table near the basket, amongst other items (tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, and milk). The basket was also on the table. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation involving two objects.  The intended outcome was to have both the cream cheese box and the butter inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** This involves approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-19)
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** This involves moving the grasped cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it. (Steps 20-21)
3. **Pick up the butter:** This involves approaching the butter, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 22-30)
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involves moving the grasped butter to the basket and releasing it. (Steps 31-39)
