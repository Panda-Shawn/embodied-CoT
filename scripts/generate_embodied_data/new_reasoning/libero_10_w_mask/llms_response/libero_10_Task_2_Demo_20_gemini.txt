## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The stove and moka pot were initially located on a table or wooden surface, with the moka pot specifically positioned on the stove but not necessarily in its optimal operating position. The frypan was also present on the table but did not play a role in the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the moka pot's location, positioning its gripper, and securely grasping the pot. (Steps 1-6)

2. **Lift and Rotate Moka Pot:** The robot then lifted the moka pot and rotated it, likely to adjust its orientation before placement on the stove. (Steps 7-12)

3. **Move Moka Pot to Stove:** The robot moved the grasped moka pot towards the stove. (Steps 13-18)

4. **Place Moka Pot on Stove:**  The robot precisely positioned the moka pot on the stove. (Steps 19-22)

5. **Release Grip and Retreat:** Finally, the robot released its grip on the moka pot and moved away. (Steps 23-33)
