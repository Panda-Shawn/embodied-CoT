## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was positioned such that its back compartment was accessible. The robot needed to navigate to the book, grasp it, lift it, navigate to the caddy, and place the book in its back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-5)  The robot needed to move into a position where it could reach the book without colliding with other objects on the table. This involved navigating around the table and positioning itself above the book.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 6-7) Once positioned correctly, the robot needed to grasp the book with its gripper. This involved moving down to the book and closing the gripper.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 8-10) After grasping the book, the robot needed to lift it clear of the table.

4. **Approach the caddy:** (Steps 11-14) After picking up the book, the robot needed to move to the caddy to place the book into the back compartment. This involved navigating to the caddy's back compartment while keeping the book securely held.

5. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 15-21) Once close to the caddy, the robot needed to precisely position the book and release it into the caddy's back compartment. This involved a series of movements to carefully lower the book into the compartment.
