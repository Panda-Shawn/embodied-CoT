## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating three mugs located on a table: a white mug on a left plate, a yellow and white mug on a right plate, and a red mug in the center. The objective was to rearrange the mugs according to the instruction: "put the white mug on the left plate and put the yellow and white mug on the right plate".  While this might seem redundant given their initial positions, the robot's actions suggest it may have been initially misaligned or the task implicitly included verifying the correct placement. The primary activity was precise manipulation of the mugs, involving picking up each mug, moving it to the target location, and placing it down carefully. The intended outcome was to have both the white mug and the yellow and white mug correctly positioned on their respective plates.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:


| High-Level Movement              | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up the white mug             | 0-18        | To relocate the white mug, it must first be grasped by the robot arm.                                               |
| Move and place the white mug       | 19-20       | After grasping the mug, the arm navigates to the left plate for accurate placement.                             |
| Release the white mug             | 21-38       | Carefully place the mug on the left plate.                                              |
| Pick up the yellow and white mug | 19-27       | Grab the yellow and white mug for relocation.                                                                         |
| Move and place the yellow/white mug | 28-37      | Navigate and position the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.                                                  |
| Release the yellow and white mug   | 38         | Release the grip, ensuring the mug remains on the right plate.                                                     |
