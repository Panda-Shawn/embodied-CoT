## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The stove and moka pot were initially located on a table, with the moka pot already positioned on the stove but not necessarily in an ideal location. The frypan was also present on the table but did not play a direct role in the task. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the stove and moka pot, achieving the intended outcome of having the moka pot securely positioned on the stove's heating element, ready for use.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Turn on Stove:**  (Steps 0-12) The robot first navigated to the stove and turned it on.  This involved moving to the stove's location and then interacting with its control mechanism (likely a knob).

2. **Pick up Moka Pot:** (Steps 13-25) The robot then moved to pick up the moka pot, positioning its gripper appropriately to grasp the pot's handle and lift it.

3. **Place Moka Pot on Stove:** (Steps 26-36) Finally, the robot moved the moka pot to a more ideal position on the stove and released it. This step included careful positioning for optimal heat transfer.
