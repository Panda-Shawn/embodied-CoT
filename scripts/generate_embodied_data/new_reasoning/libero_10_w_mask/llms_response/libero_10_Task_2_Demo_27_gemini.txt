## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and the moka pot to achieve the desired configuration: the moka pot sitting securely on the heated stove.  The objects involved were a flat stove, a moka pot, and a chefmate frypan (which was irrelevant to the task). Initially, the moka pot was on the stove, but presumably off. The frypan was on the table, separate from the stove and moka pot.

The general sequence of high-level movements was as follows:

1. **Approach and Turn on Stove:** The robot needed to approach the stove and activate it.  This likely involved moving towards the stove, manipulating a switch or knob to turn it on.
   * Step range: 0-10.
   * Justification:  The robot first needs to reach the stove's controls before it can proceed to place the moka pot.

2. **Pick up the Moka Pot:** The robot needed to grasp and lift the moka pot from its current position on the stove.  This required precise movements to avoid knocking over the pot.
    * Step range: 11-24.
    * Justification: Before the moka pot can be moved, the robot must secure a grip on it.

3. **Position Moka Pot on Stove:**  After picking up the moka pot, the robot would move to precisely position it on the stove. This might involve adjusting its position and orientation to ensure stable placement.
    * Step range: 25-34.
    * Justification: The robot needs to place the moka pot back onto the stove after itâ€™s been picked up.
