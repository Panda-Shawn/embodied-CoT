## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating three mugs: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug. The goal was to relocate the white mug to the left plate and the yellow and white mug to the right plate.  Initially, the white mug was already on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug was already on the right plate. The red mug was on the table but not on a plate.  The primary activity was pick-and-place, involving grasping each mug (if necessary) and moving it to the designated plate.  The high-level sequence involved:

1. **Pick and place the white mug:**  The robot confirmed the correct placement of the white mug and did nothing, technically satisfying the task requirement.
2. **Pick and place the yellow and white mug:** The robot confirmed the correct placement of the yellow and white mug and did nothing, technically satisfying the task requirement.

Therefore, the seemingly complex trajectory actually reflects a mostly idle robot observing its current environment and confirming the conditions already met. It involves little to no actual movement of mugs.


High-Level Movements:

1. **Confirm White Mug Placement:** Steps 0-10.  This high-level movement involved verifying the position of the white mug and was unnecessary since it was already in the correct position. The robot stopped to check its environment.
2. **Confirm Yellow and White Mug Placement:** Steps 11-20. Similar to the first movement, this stage checked the position of the yellow and white mug.  It was unnecessary as it was already in its correct location.
3. **Idle/Confirmation:** Steps 21-40. This includes confirmation steps and periods of inactivity, indicating that the robot deemed the task complete.
