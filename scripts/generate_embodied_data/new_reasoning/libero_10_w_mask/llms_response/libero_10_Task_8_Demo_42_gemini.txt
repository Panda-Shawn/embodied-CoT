## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The initial state showed two moka pots positioned near the stove, which was itself situated on a flat surface (likely a table or floor). The robot needed to pick up each moka pot individually, move it to the stove, and place it down carefully. This required a sequence of movements encompassing approach, grasping, lifting, transportation, positioning, and releasing.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the first moka pot:** (Steps 0-11) The robot needed to navigate to the first moka pot and secure a firm grip.
2. **Lift and place the first moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 12-22) This involved lifting the pot, moving it to the stove, and carefully releasing it.
3. **Approach and grasp the second moka pot:** (Steps 23-30)  The robot repeated the approach and grasping process for the second moka pot.
4. **Lift and place the second moka pot on the stove:** (Steps 31-40) The robot finalized the task by carefully positioning and releasing the second pot on the stove.
