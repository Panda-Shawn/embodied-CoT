## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter from a table and placing them into a basket.  The cream cheese box and butter were located next to each other on a wooden table, with other items (milk, orange juice, tomato sauce) nearby. The basket's location isn't explicitly defined but is implied to be reachable from the table. The general sequence of movements involved approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, moving it to the basket, then repeating the process for the butter.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 1-19)  This involved moving the robotic arm to the cream cheese box's location, grasping it, and lifting it.  The proximity of other items (milk and orange juice) necessitated careful maneuvering to avoid collisions.

2. **Place Cream Cheese Box in Basket:** (Steps 19-20) This movement involved moving the arm with the cream cheese box to the basketâ€™s location.  The exact location of the basket is not explicitly described in the setup, implying this movement likely combined moving towards the basket location, orienting the arm to appropriately deposit the cream cheese box.

3. **Pick up Butter:** (Steps 20-28) This stage mirrored the first high-level movement, involving approaching the butter, grasping it, and lifting it. This required avoiding collision with the already placed cream cheese box.

4. **Place Butter in Basket:** (Steps 29-39) This phase involved moving the arm with the butter to the basket, potentially requiring slight adjustments for placement alongside the cream cheese box.

5. **Return to Neutral Position:** (Steps 39-41) The robot returns to a resting position after completing the task.
