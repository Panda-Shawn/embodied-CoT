## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The initial state showed the cream cheese box and butter positioned separately on the table, along with other items. The robot's primary activity was manipulation, specifically picking up each object and placing it into the basket. The intended outcome was a state where both the cream cheese box and the butter resided within the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** This involved navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 0-16)

2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** This involved moving the cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it. (Steps 17-30)

3. **Pick up the butter:** This involved navigating to the butter, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 31-35)

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involved moving the butter to the basket and releasing it. (Steps 36-37)
