## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a can of alphabet soup and a cream cheese box into a basket.  Initially, the alphabet soup and cream cheese box were positioned on a surface within reach of the robotic arm, while the basket was located some distance away.  The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it, transport it to the basket, and place it inside.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed was:

1. **Approach and grasp the alphabet soup:** The robot had to move to the location of the alphabet soup, orient itself correctly, grasp the soup can with its gripper, and lift it.

2. **Transport the alphabet soup to the basket:** The robot moved the alphabet soup towards the basket while maintaining a stable grasp.

3. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** The robot carefully released the alphabet soup inside the basket.

4. **Approach and grasp the cream cheese box:**  The robot moved to the cream cheese box, oriented itself, and grasped it.

5. **Transport the cream cheese box to the basket:** The robot moved the cream cheese box to the basket while maintaining a stable grasp.

6. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** The robot released the cream cheese box inside the basket.

7. **Return to home position:** The robot likely moved to a designated home or resting position.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

| High-Level Movement                     | Trajectory Steps | Justification                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and grasp alphabet soup        | 0-7               | Robot needs to position itself to pick up the alphabet soup. Steps 0-5 involve approach and orientation, step 7 is grasping. |
| Transport alphabet soup to basket       | 8-12              | Robot moves the alphabet soup towards the basket. Steps 9-10 are lifting and movement, step 12 is releasing.      |
| Approach and grasp cream cheese box     | 13-19             | Robot moves to pick up the cream cheese box. Steps 16-17 involve approach, steps 18-19 is grasping.              |
| Transport cream cheese box to basket     | 20-26              | Robot moves the cream cheese box towards the basket. Steps 24-25 are lifting and movement, step 26 is releasing.    |
| Return to home position (or stop)      | 27-42              | Robot returns to a resting position after completing the task.                                                |
