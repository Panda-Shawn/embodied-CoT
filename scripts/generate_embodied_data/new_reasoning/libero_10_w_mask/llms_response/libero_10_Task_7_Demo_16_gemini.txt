## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box into a basket situated on a wooden table.  Other items present on the table included a tomato sauce bottle and a ketchup bottle, positioned near the cream cheese box. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robot arm to grasp each item individually and place it in the basket. The intended outcome was the successful deposition of both items within the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot can be described as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Alphabet Soup:** The robot first moved to the location of the alphabet soup, grasped it, and then moved to the basket to deposit it.  (Steps 0-9)

2. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese Box:**  The robot next moved to the location of the cream cheese box, grasped it, and moved it to the basket. (Steps 10-26)

3. **Final adjustments and completion:** The robot made final adjustments to the cream cheese box's positioning within the basket, and completed the task. (Steps 27-41)
