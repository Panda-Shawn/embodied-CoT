## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer. The environment included a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (middle), a wine bottle (right), and a black Akita bowl (inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet).  The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to precisely locate and grasp the bowl, extract it from the drawer, and then close the drawer. The intended outcome was the black bowl being removed from the cabinet and the drawer being securely shut.

The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** (Steps 1-12) The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet and position itself to open the drawer.  This involved moving forward, rotating to face the cabinet, and lowering itself to drawer level.

2. **Open Drawer and Retrieve Bowl:** (Steps 13-21)  The robot opened the drawer, grasped the bowl, and then lifted it out of the drawer.

3. **Move Bowl Away:** (Steps 22-28) The robot moved the bowl to a clear location away from the cabinet to avoid collisions during the next phase.

4. **Close Drawer:** (Steps 29-43) The robot returned to the cabinet and closed the drawer.
