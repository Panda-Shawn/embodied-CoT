## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black Akita bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and the target Akita black bowl (inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet). The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, remove it, and finally close the drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to the Cabinet:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to move to a position in front of the cabinet to begin interacting with it.  This involved moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the cabinet.

2. **Open the Cabinet Drawer:** (Steps 8-17) The robot had to reach the cabinet drawer, open it, and prepare to grasp the bowl. This involves moving down to the drawer, opening the gripper in preparation for grasping the bowl.

3. **Grasp and Retrieve the Bowl:** (Steps 18-20)  The robot had to grasp the bowl and lift it out of the drawer.  This required precise movements to pick up the bowl.

4. **Move Away from the Cabinet:** (Steps 21-27) The robot had to move to a safe distance from the cabinet with the bowl.

5. **Close the Cabinet Drawer:** (Steps 28-29)  The final step involved closing the cabinet drawer.
