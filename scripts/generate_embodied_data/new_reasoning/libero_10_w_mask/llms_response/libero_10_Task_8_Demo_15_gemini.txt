## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove. The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The robot needed to pick up each moka pot individually, move it to the stove, and carefully place it down.  The general sequence of high-level movements can be described as follows:

1. **Approach and Pick up the first moka pot:** The robot needed to navigate to the first moka pot, grasp it securely with its gripper, and lift it.
2. **Move the first moka pot to the stove:** The robot needed to transport the moka pot to the stove, maintaining a stable grip.
3. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** The robot needed to carefully position the moka pot on the stove's surface.
4. **Approach and pick up the second moka pot:** The robot needed to repeat the process for the second moka pot.
5. **Move the second moka pot to the stove:** The robot needed to transport the second moka pot to the stove.
6. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** The robot needed to position the second moka pot on the stove.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements with their corresponding step ranges:

| High-Level Movement                 | Step Range | Justification                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and pick up first moka pot | 0-17       |  The robot needs to position itself, grasp the first pot, and lift it for transport. |
| Move first moka pot to the stove     | 18-18      | Positioning above the stove to prepare for placing the first pot.                      |
| Place first moka pot on the stove    | 19-34      | The robot needs to gently lower and release the first pot onto the stove.          |
| Approach and pick up second moka pot | 0-17      | This is similar to step 1, but for the second moka pot.                          |
| Move second moka pot to the stove     | 18-18       | Positioning above the stove to prepare for placing the second pot.                  |
| Place second moka pot on the stove    | 19-34      | The robot needs to gently lower and release the second pot onto the stove.          |
