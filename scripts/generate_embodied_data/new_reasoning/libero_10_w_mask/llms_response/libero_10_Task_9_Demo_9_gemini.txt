## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a yellow and white mug from its location on a table to inside a microwave and then closing the microwave door. The relevant objects were the yellow and white mug, a microwave, and a porcelain mug (which played no direct role in the task). The yellow and white mug was positioned in front of the microwave.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the mug, grasping the mug, moving the mug to the microwave, placing the mug inside the microwave, and closing the microwave door.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Mug:** Steps 0-15. This movement was necessary to get the robot arm into position to pick up the target mug.  The robot needed to navigate to the mug's location, orient itself correctly, and then close the gripper to secure the mug.

2. **Move Mug to Microwave:** Steps 16-21. After grasping the mug, the robot needed to transport it to the microwave opening.

3. **Place Mug in Microwave:** Steps 22-39. This involved carefully positioning the mug within the microwave's interior.

4. **Close Microwave:** Steps 40-51.  This involved moving the robot arm away from the microwave and then closing the microwave door.
