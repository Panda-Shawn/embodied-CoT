## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating two mugs and two plates.  The white mug was initially located somewhere within the robot's reach, as was a yellow and white mug.  Two plates, designated "left" and "right," were also within reach. The primary activity was to move the mugs to their designated plates. The intended outcome was to have the white mug on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed was:

1. **Pick up the white mug:**  This involves approaching the white mug, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-10)
2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** This involves moving the grasped mug to the left plate and releasing it. (Steps 11-21)
3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** This involves approaching the yellow and white mug, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 22-28)
4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** This involves moving the grasped mug to the right plate and releasing it. (Steps 29-37)
