## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The robot needed to grasp each pot individually, lift it, and place it on the stove.  The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach and grasp the first moka pot:** This involves moving towards the first moka pot, positioning the gripper, and grasping the pot. (Steps 0-9)
2. **Lift and place the first moka pot on the stove:**  This involves lifting the grasped pot, moving it to the stove, and placing it down. (Steps 10-18)
3. **Approach and grasp the second moka pot:** Similar to step 1, this involves approaching the second moka pot, positioning, and grasping. (Steps 19-22)
4. **Lift and place the second moka pot on the stove:** Similar to step 2, this involves lifting, moving to the stove, and placing the second pot. (Steps 23-37)
