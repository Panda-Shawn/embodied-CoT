## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer. The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and a black Akita bowl (inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet).  The primary activity was manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the goal state: the black bowl being inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet, with the drawer closed. The intended outcome was the successful placement and containment of the bowl within the drawer.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed was:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** The robot needs to navigate to the cabinet to be able to interact with it.
2. **Open the cabinet drawer:** Access to the bowl requires opening the cabinet's bottom drawer.
3. **Retrieve the black bowl:** The robot must grasp the bowl from inside the drawer.
4. **Place the black bowl in the drawer:** The bowl needs to be placed back in the drawer, ensuring itâ€™s properly positioned.
5. **Close the cabinet drawer:** The final step involves closing the cabinet drawer securely.


High-level movement breakdown:

| High-Level Movement      | Step Range | Justification                                                                         |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the cabinet     | 1-5        | The robot needs to position itself near the cabinet to reach the drawer.                  |
| Open the cabinet drawer  | 6-8        |  Accessing the bowl requires opening the drawer.                                        |
| Retrieve the black bowl | 9-15       |  The robot needs to grasp the bowl to lift it from the drawer.                        |
| Place the black bowl    | 16-28      |  The robot needs to carefully place the bowl back into the drawer.                   |
| Close the cabinet drawer | 29         | The final action is to close the drawer to complete the task.                        |
