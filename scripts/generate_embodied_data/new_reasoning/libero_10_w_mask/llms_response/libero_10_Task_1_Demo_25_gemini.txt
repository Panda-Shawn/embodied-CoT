## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  Both the cream cheese box and the butter were initially located next to each other on the table, near the basket. The primary activity was the manipulation of these two objects to transfer them into the basket. The intended outcome was to have both items successfully placed inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 0-7)  The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the cream cheese box. This involved navigating to the general area of the cream cheese box and then positioning its gripper for grasping.

2. **Lift and Transport Cream Cheese Box:** (Steps 8-15) After grasping the cream cheese box, the robot needed to lift it and move it away from its original location to avoid interference with the next step.


3. **Approach and Grasp Butter:** (Steps 16-24)  The robot then needed to move to the butter, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place Both Items in Basket:** (Steps 25-34) With both items grasped, the robot needed to move to the basket and place both items inside it.  This would involve careful positioning to ensure both items fit.
