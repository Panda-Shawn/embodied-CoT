## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a can of alphabet soup and a cream cheese box into a basket.  Initially, the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box were positioned separately on a surface within reach of the robotic arm. The basket was also within the robot's workspace. The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it, lift it, and then transport it to the basket, depositing it carefully.  This required a sequence of movements including approaching each object, grasping, lifting, moving to the basket, and releasing the object.  The robot likely had to avoid collisions with both the objects and the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Grasp Alphabet Soup:** Steps 0-20. The robot needed to approach the alphabet soup, pick it up, and then move away to avoid collision with the next object and the basket.
2. **Grasp Cream Cheese Box:** Steps 21-44. The robot approaches the cream cheese box, picks it up, moves to the basket, and places it in the basket.
