## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box was positioned next to a tomato sauce bottle, both on the table. The alphabet soup's initial location isn't explicitly stated, but it's inferred to be somewhere accessible to the robotic arm. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being both items successfully deposited within the basket.

The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the soup's location, grasping it, and then lifting it.  (Steps 1-17)

2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** This involved moving the arm to the basket, positioning the soup above it, releasing it and then moving away from the area to create room for the second object. (Steps 18-39)

3. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** Similar to the first step, but targeting the cream cheese box. (Steps 20-28)

4. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Placing the second item into the basket and then finishing the task. (Steps 29-41)


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up alphabet soup        | 1-17        | To acquire the first object needed for placement in the basket.                |
| Place alphabet soup in basket | 18-39       | To deposit the first object into the designated location.                   |
| Pick up cream cheese box      | 20-28       | To acquire the second object for placement in the basket.                    |
| Place cream cheese box in basket | 29-41       | To deposit the second object into the basket and complete the task.           |
