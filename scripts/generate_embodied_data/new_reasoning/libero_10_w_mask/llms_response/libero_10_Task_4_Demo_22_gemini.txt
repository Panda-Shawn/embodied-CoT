## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging four mugs (one white, one yellow and white, one red) and two plates on a surface. The goal was to place the single white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  Initially, the mugs were in a different arrangement. The robot needed to pick up each mug, move it to its designated plate, and then place it down carefully. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Picking up the white mug from the right plate:** The robot had to locate the white mug, approach it, grasp it, and lift it without disturbing other objects.

2. **Placing the white mug on the left plate:** The robot moved the grasped white mug to the left plate and carefully placed it down.

3. **Picking up the yellow and white mug from the left plate:**  The robot located the yellow and white mug, approached it, grasped it, and lifted it.

4. **Placing the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** The robot moved the grasped yellow and white mug to the right plate and carefully placed it down.


**High-Level Movements:**

| High-Level Movement                     | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up the white mug from the right plate | 0-10       | This is the first object to move, and it's necessary to clear space and to complete the first part of the task.  |
| Place the white mug on the left plate   | 11-18      | This places the first mug in its correct location.                                                             |
| Pick up the yellow and white mug from the left plate | 19-32      | The second part of the task, moving the second mug.                                                      |
| Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate | 33-44      | This completes the second half of the task.                                                                |
