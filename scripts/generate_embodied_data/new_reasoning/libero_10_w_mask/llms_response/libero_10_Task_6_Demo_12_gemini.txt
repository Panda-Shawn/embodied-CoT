## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating two objects, a white mug and a chocolate pudding, to specific locations relative to a plate on a table. The intended outcome was to have the white mug placed on the plate and the chocolate pudding positioned to the right of the plate.  The initial environment contained a wooden table with a white mug already on a plate, a red coffee mug to the right of the plate, and a chocolate pudding to the right of the white mug. The robot needed to reposition the pudding, leaving the mug on the plate undisturbed.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:**  (Steps 0-8) This involved moving the robotic arm to the pudding's location and grasping it.

2. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** (Steps 9-18)  This involved moving the arm to the desired location and releasing the pudding.

3. **Stop**: (Steps 18 - 34)
