## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy. The book was located on the table, with a white and yellow mug positioned in front of it. The caddy was situated behind the mug.  The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the book's safe transfer to the caddy's back compartment.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-7)  The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the book. This involved moving towards the book, avoiding obstacles (the mug).

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 5-7) The robot had to lower its gripper to the book and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 8-9) The robot lifted the book from the table, ensuring a secure hold.

4. **Navigate to the caddy:** (Steps 10-14) This involved moving the book, while avoiding collision with objects like the mug and caddy, and positioning itself to place the book in the back compartment.  The rotation indicates careful maneuvering around the mug and to align with the caddyâ€™s compartment.

5. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 16-23)  The robot carefully lowered the book into the caddy's back compartment.
