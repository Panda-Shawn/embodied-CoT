## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to grasp each moka pot individually, lift it, and then place it on the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots positioned securely on the stove. The objects involved were two moka pots, a stove, and a surface (likely a table or floor) on which the stove rested. Initially, the moka pots were likely positioned near the stove but not on it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** This encompasses steps 0-19. The robot needs to approach the first pot, grasp it, and lift it.

2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** This involves steps 20-27.  The robot needs to move to the stove and carefully place the pot down.

3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** This includes steps 28-40. The robot must navigate to the second pot, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** This phase consists of steps 41-46.  The robot needs to place the second pot onto the stove.
