## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and the butter were initially located next to each other on the table, near the basket. The robot needed to grasp each item individually, lift it, and then place it inside the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:**  The robot approached the cream cheese box, grasped it, and lifted it.
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** The robot moved the cream cheese box to the basket and placed it inside.
3. **Pick up the butter:** The robot approached the butter, grasped it, and lifted it.
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** The robot moved the butter to the basket and placed it inside.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements identified from the trajectory, along with their step ranges and justifications:

| High-Level Movement           | Step Range | Justification                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up the cream cheese box | 0-17        | This involves navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it clear of the table. |
| Place cream cheese in basket   | 18-27       | This involves moving the cream cheese box to the basket and depositing it inside.            |
| Pick up the butter            | 19-35       | This involves navigating to the butter, grasping it, and lifting it clear of the table.    |
| Place butter in basket        | 36-37       | This involves moving the butter to the basket and depositing it inside.                |
