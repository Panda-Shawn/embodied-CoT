### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was positioned some distance away from the book. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from its initial position on the table to the back compartment of the caddy.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of the following high-level movements:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 0-4) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could reach the book. This involved moving forward and rotating to align with the book's location.

2. **Pick up the book:** (Steps 5-10)  Once in position, the robot had to lower its gripper, grasp the book, and ensure a secure grip.

3. **Move to the caddy:** (Steps 11-17) After securing the book, the robot had to move to the location of the caddy, requiring navigation and potentially adjusting orientation.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 18-20) Finally, the robot needed to position the book within the caddy's back compartment and release its grip.
