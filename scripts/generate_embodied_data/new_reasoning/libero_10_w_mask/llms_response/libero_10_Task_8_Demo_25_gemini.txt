## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation repeated twice: once for each moka pot. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots positioned securely on the stove.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp First Moka Pot:** Steps 1-13. This involves moving the robotic arm towards the first moka pot, adjusting its orientation to grasp it properly, and then securely closing the gripper around the pot.  This movement is necessary to acquire the first object needed for placement.

2. **Place First Moka Pot on Stove:** Steps 14-23. This involves moving the grasped moka pot to the stove and carefully releasing it.  This action places the first moka pot in its designated location.

3. **Approach and Grasp Second Moka Pot:** Steps 24-36. This is a near mirror image of the first high-level movement, involving moving towards the second moka pot, orienting the arm, and grasping the pot.  This movement is required to pick up the second object.

4. **Place Second Moka Pot on Stove:** Steps 37-48.  This completes the task by moving the second moka pot to the stove and placing it next to the first.  This finalizes the task objective.
