## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and the moka pot to achieve the desired configuration: the moka pot sitting on the activated stove. The objects involved were a moka pot, a flat stove, and a chefmate frypan (which played no role in the task). Initially, the moka pot was already on the stove, and the stove was off. The frypan was on the table near the stove.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the stove, turning on the stove, and confirming the moka pot's position.


High-level movements:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-15.  This movement was necessary to position the robot arm close enough to interact with the stove and moka pot.

2. **Turn on the stove:** Steps 16-24. This involved manipulating the stove's controls to activate it.

3. **Confirm moka pot position (implicit):** Steps 25-36. While not an explicit action, the robot likely performed a check to ensure the moka pot was correctly positioned. This is implied by the minor adjustments and final repositioning.
