## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially positioned on the stove, but not necessarily correctly aligned or securely placed. The stove and moka pot were located on a table, along with a chefmate frypan. The robot's primary objective was to manipulate the moka pot (if necessary) and ensure it was properly situated on the stove.  This likely involved adjusting the moka pot's position and/or confirming it was properly centered and stable on the stove burner. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Approaching the Moka Pot:** The robot first moved to a position near the moka pot, to allow for the most efficient manipulation.

2. **Grasping the Moka Pot:** The robot grasped the handle of the moka pot.

3. **Adjusting the Moka Pot (if needed):** This might involve lifting the moka pot slightly to center it, or making minor rotational adjustments for optimal placement.

4. **Placing the Moka Pot:**  The robot carefully placed the moka pot down securely on the stove.

5. **Releasing the Moka Pot:** The robot released its grasp on the moka pot.

6. **Retreating:** The robot moved back to a safe distance.


**High-Level Movement Breakdown:**

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approaching the Moka Pot     | 0-3         | To position the robotic arm for efficient grasping.                             |
| Grasping the Moka Pot       | 4           | To gain control of the moka pot for manipulation and placement.                |
| Adjusting the Moka Pot      | 6-23       | To ensure proper centering and alignment of the moka pot on the stove burner.  |
| Placing the Moka Pot        | 24-26      | To carefully and securely place the moka pot onto the stove.                     |
| Releasing the Moka Pot      | 27-36     | To complete the task and avoid unintended interference.                       |
| Retreating                  | 38-39       | To move the robot arm out of the way, completing the task.                     |
