## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially positioned on the stove, but the stove was off. The robot needed to manipulate the moka pot (if necessary) and then activate the stove's switch.  The frypan was present on the table but was not involved in the task. The high-level movements required were:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 1-6) This involved moving the robotic arm to the moka pot's location and securely grasping it.  This was necessary because the robot might need to reposition the pot or ensure it is stable before turning on the stove.  The assumption is the robot's initial position is somewhat distant from the stove and the moka pot.

2. **(Optional) Reposition Moka Pot:** (Steps 7-9) This phase is potentially skipped if the initial moka pot position is deemed acceptable. The robot might need to slightly adjust the moka pot's orientation on the stove. This is evidenced by the 'rotate clockwise' and 'open gripper' actions.

3. **Turn on the Stove:** (Steps 10-18) The robot manipulates the stove's switch. This involved moving to the stove's switch, and possibly tilting and rotating its arm to reach the switch's optimal activating position.  The 'move up', 'move forward up', 'tilt up' actions suggest approaching the stove from a side angle for optimal reach.

4. **Release Moka Pot:** (Steps 19-22) After turning on the stove, the robot releases the moka pot, ensuring it's securely placed on the heated surface.

5. **Retreat:** (Steps 23-32) The robot moves back to a safe distance after successfully completing the task.
