## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved manipulating two mugs and two plates.  A white mug and a yellow-and-white mug were initially positioned somewhere within the robot's reach. Two plates, designated "left" and "right," were also within reach. The primary activity was to pick up each mug and place it on the designated plate: the white mug on the left plate and the yellow-and-white mug on the right plate. The intended outcome was to have both mugs correctly positioned on their respective plates.  The general sequence of movements involved picking up one mug, placing it on the correct plate, then repeating the process for the second mug.  The trajectory suggests a sequential approach, rather than attempting to grasp both mugs simultaneously.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** Steps 0-18. This involves moving to the white mug, grasping it, and then lifting it.
2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** Steps 18-20.  This involves moving to the left plate and releasing the mug.
3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** Steps 20-34.  This involves moving to the yellow and white mug, grasping it, and then lifting it.
4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** Steps 34-35. This involves moving to the right plate and releasing the mug.
