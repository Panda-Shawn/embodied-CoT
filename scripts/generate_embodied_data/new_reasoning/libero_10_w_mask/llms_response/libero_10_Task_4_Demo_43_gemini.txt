## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging two mugs onto designated plates.  The environment contained three mugs: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red coffee mug. Initially, the white mug rested on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug was on the right plate. The red mug was not on a plate. The primary activity was to maintain the position of the white mug on the left plate while moving the yellow and white mug from the right plate to the left plate.  This resulted in the white mug on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug on the left plate. The red mug remained untouched.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** (Steps 4-19)  This was necessary to free the mug for repositioning.

2. **Place the yellow and white mug on the left plate:** (Steps 20-36) This fulfilled the second part of the instruction.

3. **Stop:** (Steps 37) The task is completed.
