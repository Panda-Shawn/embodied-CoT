## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black book from a table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The environment consisted of a wooden table, a white and yellow mug positioned in front of a black book, and a desk caddy located behind the mug.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, with the intended outcome being the book's successful transfer from the table to the caddy's back compartment. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the book, grasping the book, lifting the book, moving to the caddy, and placing the book in the caddy.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the book:** Steps 0-4. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm within reach of the book.

2. **Grasp the book:** Steps 5-7.  This was crucial to secure the book for subsequent lifting and transportation.

3. **Lift and move to the caddy:** Steps 8-16. This movement involved lifting the book, navigating around the mug, and approaching the caddy.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** Steps 17-22. This involved precisely positioning and releasing the book into the caddy's back compartment.
