## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy. The book was located on the table, with a white and yellow mug positioned in front of it. The caddy was situated behind the mug.  The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movements to avoid collisions and successfully place the book in the target location. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** This involved navigating the robot arm to a position close enough to the book to initiate grasping. (Steps 1-5)  This was necessary to get the arm within reach of the book without colliding with the mug.

2. **Grasp the book:** This involved precisely positioning the gripper above the book and closing it to secure a grip. (Steps 6-9) This was crucial to successfully pick up the book.

3. **Lift and move the book:** This involved lifting the book from the table and moving it towards the caddy's back compartment, avoiding obstacles. (Steps 11-13) Lifting the book allowed for movement and maneuvering around the mug.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** This involved positioning the book over the caddy's back compartment and opening the gripper to release it. (Steps 14-20) This ensured the book was placed safely within the designated area.
