## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket.  The robot operated in an environment containing a basket, milk carton, orange juice carton, butter box, cream cheese, ketchup bottle, alphabet soup, and tomato sauce (implied by the task instruction). The basket was located on a table, with the milk and orange juice cartons nearby. The butter box was near the milk carton, and the ketchup bottle was next to the butter box. The alphabet soup was initially inside the basket.  The tomato sauce's initial location is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it was somewhere else in the environment. The robot needed to pick up the tomato sauce and place it in the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 1-20.  This involved maneuvering to the tomato sauce's location, grasping it, and lifting it.

2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 21-40. This involved moving the grasped tomato sauce to the basket and releasing it.

3. **Stop:** Steps 41.
