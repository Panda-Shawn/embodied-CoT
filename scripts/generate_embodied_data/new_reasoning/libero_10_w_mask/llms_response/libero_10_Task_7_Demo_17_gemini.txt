## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box into a basket located on a table.  The cream cheese box was already in the basket, while the alphabet soup was positioned elsewhere on the table. Other objects, a tomato sauce and ketchup bottle, were present near the basket, but not directly relevant to the task.

The robot's high-level plan likely involved the following movements:

1. **Approach and grasp the alphabet soup:** (Steps 1-11) The robot needed to navigate to the alphabet soup's location and securely grasp it using its gripper. This required a series of movements to position the arm correctly and manipulate the gripper.

2. **Lift and transport the alphabet soup to the basket:** (Steps 12-19) After grasping the alphabet soup, the robot had to lift it, move it over to the basket, and carefully place it inside.

3. **Approach and confirm placement of cream cheese:** (Steps 20-24)  Since the cream cheese box was already in the basket, the robot needed to move to ensure its placement was satisfactory.

4. **Stop. No further action needed:** (Steps 25-40)  The task was completed after this. This seems unnecessary, but it is clear from the trajectory that the cream cheese was touched after being confirmed already in the basket.
