## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden surface and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the floor or table alongside a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was located some distance away, with its back compartment as the designated drop-off point.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-8)  The robot needed to navigate to the book's location before attempting to grasp it. This involved maneuvering around the environment to avoid obstacles (the mug).

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 7-8)  Once positioned correctly, the robot had to close its gripper around the book to secure a hold.

3. **Lift and move to the caddy:** (Steps 9-16) After grasping the book, the robot needed to lift it and transport it to the caddy's location.

4. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 17-20) Finally, the robot had to position itself above the caddy's back compartment and carefully place the book inside.
