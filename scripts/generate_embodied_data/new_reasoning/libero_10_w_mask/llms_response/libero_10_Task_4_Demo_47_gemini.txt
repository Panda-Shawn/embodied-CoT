## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating three mugs situated on a table with two plates.  The objective was to rearrange the mugs onto the plates according to a specific arrangement: the white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate. A red coffee mug, irrelevant to the task, was also present on the table.

The robot executed the task by following a plan that consisted of several high-level movements:


1. **Pick up the white mug:** (Steps 0-14).  This involved positioning the robotic arm, grasping the white mug, and lifting it. This was necessary to move the white mug from its initial position to the left plate.

2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** (Steps 15-24). This involved moving the arm to the left plate and carefully releasing the mug.

3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** (Steps 25-42). This involved repositioning the arm to grasp the yellow and white mug and then lifting it. This was necessary to transfer this mug to the right plate.

4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** (Steps 43-46). This involved moving the arm to the right plate, releasing the mug and returning to a resting position.
