## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both the alphabet soup and the cream cheese box into a basket.  The initial state of the environment showed the basket on a table or floor, the cream cheese box next to the basket, the alphabet soup already inside the basket, the tomato sauce next to the ketchup, and the ketchup next to the cream cheese box.  The primary activity was manipulation of objects; the intended outcome was to have both items in the basket.  Note that the alphabet soup was already in the basket, thus simplifying the task. The high-level movements likely followed by the robot are:

1. **Approach and grasp the cream cheese box:** Steps 1-12. This was necessary to pick up the cream cheese box, which was adjacent to the basket.
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Steps 13-20.  This involved lifting the box and moving it into the basket.
3. **Approach and grasp the alphabet soup (redundant):** Steps 21-26. Although the alphabet soup was already in the basket, the trajectory suggests a (redundant) attempt to pick it up.  This might be due to imperfect state estimation or a policy that prioritizes confirming object locations.
4. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket (redundant):** Steps 27-36.  This further confirms the redundancy of steps related to the alphabet soup.
