## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The environment contained a black book, a white and yellow mug (near the book), and a desk caddy (located in the back compartment). The primary activity was manipulation of the book, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the table to the caddyâ€™s back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** This involved maneuvering the robotic arm to a position above the book, preparing for grasping.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the book:** This involved lowering the arm to pick up the book using the gripper. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the book:** This involved raising the arm to lift the book from the table. (Steps 7-9)
4. **Move to the caddy:** This involved moving the arm to position the book above the caddy's back compartment. (Steps 10-12)
5. **Place the book:** This involved lowering the arm and placing the book inside the caddy. (Steps 14-15)
