## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging three mugs on a table with two plates.  The goal was to place a white mug onto the left plate and a yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  The initial state showed a white mug already on the left plate, a yellow and white mug already on the right plate, and a red mug not on either plate.  Therefore, the robot only needed to ensure the correct mugs were positioned on their respective plates, potentially involving adjustments if they were slightly misaligned.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Pick up the white mug | 3-5 | To ensure the white mug is correctly positioned on the left plate.  Even though it's already on the left plate, a slight adjustment might be needed. |
| Place the white mug on the left plate | 6-18 | To precisely position the white mug on the left plate. |
| Pick up the yellow and white mug | 24-28 | To ensure the yellow and white mug is correctly positioned on the right plate.  Again, a slight adjustment might be needed. |
| Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate | 29-40 | To precisely position the yellow and white mug on the right plate.  This might involve rotation to align the mug correctly. |
