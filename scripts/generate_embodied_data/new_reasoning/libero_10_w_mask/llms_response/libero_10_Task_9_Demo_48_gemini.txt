## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a specific mug (yellow and white) into a microwave and then closing the microwave door.  The environment contained a yellow and white mug, a white mug, a microwave, and a wooden table. Initially, the yellow and white mug was on the table, near the microwave. The white mug was also on the table. The microwave was on the table.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug (Steps 0-10):** The robot needed to navigate to the yellow and white mug's location, position itself correctly for grasping, and then grasp the mug using its gripper. This involved moving toward the mug, adjusting its orientation, and closing the gripper.

2. **Place the Mug in the Microwave (Steps 11-15):**  After grasping the mug, the robot had to move the mug to the microwave's interior. This required precise movement and orientation adjustments to avoid collisions and successfully place the mug inside.

3. **Close the Microwave (Steps 16-31):**  Finally, the robot had to close the microwave door. This involved positioning itself appropriately near the microwave's door, and then executing the necessary movements to close it.
