## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer. The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and a black Akita bowl located inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet.  The primary activity was manipulation of the robot arm to achieve the intended outcome: the black bowl being placed in a readily accessible location outside the cabinet drawer,  while ensuring the drawer was closed afterward.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach and grasp the cabinet drawer:** Steps 1-7.  This was necessary to gain access to the black bowl within the cabinet.

2. **Open the drawer and retrieve the bowl:** Steps 8-17.  This involved opening the drawer to access the bowl and then gripping it.

3. **Lift the bowl out of the cabinet:** Steps 18-19. This is necessary to remove the bowl from the cabinet.

4. **Move the bowl to a safe, designated area:** Steps 20-29.  This repositioned the bowl to a temporary location while the drawer was closed.

5. **Close the drawer:** Steps 26-30. This completes the task.
