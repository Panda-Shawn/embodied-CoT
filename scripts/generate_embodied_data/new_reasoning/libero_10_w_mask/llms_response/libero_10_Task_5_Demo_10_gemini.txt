## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The desk caddy was also on the table. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, requiring precise movements to grasp it without disturbing the mug and then transporting it to the caddy's back compartment. The intended outcome was the book's secure placement within the caddy.

The high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the book:** (Steps 1-4) The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position close enough to the book to initiate grasping. This involved a combination of lateral and forward movements to position the arm optimally.

2. **Grasp the book:** (Steps 5-8)  The robot had to lower its gripper, approach the book, and then close the gripper around it to securely hold the object.

3. **Lift the book:** (Steps 9-10) The robot needed to lift the book clear of the table, to avoid dragging it or causing it to fall.

4. **Transport the book to the caddy:** (Steps 11-17) The robot needed to carefully move the book to the caddy, navigating potential obstacles while maintaining the bookâ€™s secure grasp.  This includes both translational and rotational adjustments.

5. **Place the book in the caddy:** (Steps 18-24)  The robot needed to precisely position the book within the back compartment of the caddy and release it gently.  This involved lowering the arm and opening the gripper.
