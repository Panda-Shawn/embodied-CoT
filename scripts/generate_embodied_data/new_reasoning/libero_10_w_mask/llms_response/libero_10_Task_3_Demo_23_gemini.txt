## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black Akita bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer. The environment included a white cabinet on the left, a wine rack on the right, a wine bottle in the middle, and the target black bowl inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet.  The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, retrieve it, and then close the drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to position itself appropriately in front of the cabinet to access the drawer. This involved moving forward and adjusting its orientation to face the cabinet.

2. **Open Drawer:** (Steps 6-11)  The robot needed to reach the cabinet drawer, open it, and prepare to grasp the bowl. This involved moving down towards the drawer, then tilting upwards slightly for better access and then closing the gripper in preparation for grasping the bowl.

3. **Retrieve Bowl:** (Steps 12-21) The robot had to grasp the bowl and lift it out of the drawer.  This involved moving up to clear the cabinet, lifting the bowl clear, and then opening the gripper to secure the bowl.

4. **Return to Starting Position:** (Steps 22-31) The robot had to reposition itself away from the cabinet, closing the drawer in the process.
