## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved arranging two objects, a white mug and a chocolate pudding, relative to a striped plate on a table.  The initial state showed the white mug already on the plate, and the chocolate pudding located elsewhere on the table. The primary objective was to reposition the pudding to the right of the plate. This required a sequence of actions involving grasping, moving, and precisely placing both the mug (to ensure it remained on the plate) and the pudding.


The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:


1. **Pick up the white mug:** (Steps 0-11) This initial movement involved navigating to the mug, grasping it carefully, and lifting it slightly to ensure a secure grip before further manipulation.  This was necessary to avoid accidentally dislodging the mug during the subsequent repositioning of the pudding.

2. **Move the white mug and plate (to facilitate pudding placement):** (Steps 12-22) The robot moved the mug and plate slightly to create space to the right of the plate where the chocolate pudding could then be placed. 

3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** (Steps 23-32) This involved navigating to the pudding's location, grasping it without damaging it, and lifting it.

4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** (Steps 33-50)  This phase focused on positioning the pudding in the desired location relative to the plate and, finally, releasing the grasp.
