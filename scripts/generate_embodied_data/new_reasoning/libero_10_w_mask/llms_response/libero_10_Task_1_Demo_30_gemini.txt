## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket situated on a wooden table. The cream cheese box and the butter are initially positioned next to the basket on the table.  The robot needs to navigate to each item, grasp it, and then move it to the basket.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Grasping the Cream Cheese Box:** The robot approaches the cream cheese box, picks it up using its gripper, and then moves it to a safe holding position above the basket to avoid accidentally bumping into the butter during the transfer.

2. **Grasping the Butter:** The robot then proceeds to grasp the butter, again lifting it carefully.

3. **Placing the Cream Cheese Box in the Basket:** The robot places the cream cheese box in the basket.

4. **Placing the Butter in the Basket:** The robot places the butter into the basket.


High-Level Movements:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Grasping the Cream Cheese Box (Steps 1-11):** The robot moves towards the cream cheese box, positions itself to grasp it (steps 1-3), lowers its gripper, closes the gripper to grasp the object, then lifts it carefully and moves to a safe intermediate holding position before further actions (steps 4-11). This movement is necessary to acquire the first object.


* **High-Level Movement 2: Grasping the Butter (Steps 12-26):** The robot moves to the butter's location (steps 12-16), opens its gripper (steps 14-17), positions itself for grasping (steps 19-21), and grasps the butter using its gripper (steps 22-26). This is essential to acquire the second object.


* **High-Level Movement 3: Placing the Cream Cheese Box in the Basket (Steps 27-30):** The robot moves towards the basket (steps 27-28), prepares for placing the cream cheese box and adjusts its position (steps 29-30). This movement facilitates placing the first object.


* **High-Level Movement 4: Placing the Butter in the Basket (Steps 31-39):** The robot carefully prepares and executes the placement of the butter into the basket (steps 31-39), while considering the position of the cream cheese box already in the basket. This is crucial for completing the task.


* **High-Level Movement 5: Final Stop (Steps 40):** The robot stops the action.
