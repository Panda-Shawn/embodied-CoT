## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves arranging two objects, a white mug and a chocolate pudding, relative to a striped plate on a table. The initial state shows the white mug and the chocolate pudding in arbitrary locations. The goal is to place the white mug onto the plate and position the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  The objects involved are a white mug, a red coffee mug (irrelevant to the task), a striped plate, and a chocolate pudding.  The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal are:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** The robot needs to locate the white mug, grasp it, and lift it.

2. **Place the white mug on the plate:** The robot needs to maneuver the mug above the plate and carefully place it down.

3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:**  The robot needs to locate the chocolate pudding, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** The robot needs to move the pudding to the desired location relative to the plate.


**High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:**

1. **Pick up the white mug (Steps 1-8):**  This involves initial positioning (steps 1-3), approaching the mug (steps 4-5), precise positioning above the mug (step 6), and grasping the mug (step 7).  The final "stop" at step 8 signifies the end of this high-level movement.

2. **Place the white mug on the plate (Steps 9-15):**  This involves lifting the mug (steps 9-11), moving to the plate (steps 12-13), positioning above the plate (step 14), and releasing the mug (step 15).

3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding (Steps 16-26):** This section begins with opening the gripper (step 16), moving to the pudding (steps 17-23), and finally grasping the pudding (steps 24-26).

4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate (Steps 27-31):**  This involves lifting the pudding (step 27-28), moving it to the desired position to the right of the plate (steps 29-30), and finally stopping (step 31).
