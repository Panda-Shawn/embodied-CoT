## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black Akita bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained several objects: a white cabinet (on the left), a wine rack (in the middle), a wine bottle (on the right), and the target Akita black bowl (located inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet). The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, lift it out, and finally close the drawer.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** Steps 1-5. The robot needs to move towards the cabinet to reach a position from which it can interact with the cabinet drawer. This involves navigating around other obstacles (wine rack and bottle).

2. **Open Drawer and Grasp Bowl:** Steps 6-14.  The robot needs to open the bottom drawer of the cabinet and then grasp the black bowl within it. This sequence encompasses precise positioning, gripper manipulation, and careful handling to avoid damaging the bowl.

3. **Lift Bowl Out of Drawer:** Steps 15-21. The robot needs to lift the bowl out of the drawer.  This may require a specific tilt to avoid collision and ensure the bowl remains stable.

4. **Move Away and Close Drawer:** Steps 22-25. The robot needs to move away from the cabinet while holding the bowl and then close the drawer. This involves careful maneuvering to avoid obstacles while simultaneously ensuring that the bowl remains securely held.
