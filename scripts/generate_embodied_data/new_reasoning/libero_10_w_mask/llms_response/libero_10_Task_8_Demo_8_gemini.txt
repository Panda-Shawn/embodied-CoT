## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was the manipulation and transportation of the two moka pots to their final destination on the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots securely positioned on the stove's surface.

The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Approach and Grasp the First Moka Pot:** The robot needed to move to the first moka pot, grasp it securely, and lift it. (Steps 1-13)
2. **Transport the First Moka Pot to the Stove:** The robot had to move the grasped moka pot to the stove and place it down. (Steps 14-18)
3. **Approach and Grasp the Second Moka Pot:** The robot needed to repeat the grasping process for the second moka pot. (Steps 19-25)
4. **Transport the Second Moka Pot to the Stove:** The robot had to transport the second moka pot to the stove and position it appropriately. (Steps 26-35)
