1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to put both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into the basket.  The basket is located on a table or wooden floor, with cream cheese and tomato sauce next to it. Ketchup, orange juice, milk, and butter are arranged linearly next to the cream cheese. The alphabet soup is already in the basket.  The primary activity is to pick up the tomato sauce from its current location and place it in the basket. The intended outcome is a basket containing both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Move to Tomato Sauce:** Steps 0-5.  The robot needs to position itself to grasp the tomato sauce.

2. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 3-5. The robot grasps the tomato sauce.

3. **Move to Basket:** Steps 6-9. The robot carries the tomato sauce to the basket.

4. **Place Tomato Sauce in Basket:** Steps 9-13.  The robot releases the tomato sauce into the basket.

5. **Move to an appropriate position to pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 14-19.

6. **Grasp Tomato Sauce:** Steps 20-21.  The robot grasps the tomato sauce.

7. **Move to Basket:** Steps 22-25. The robot carries the tomato sauce to the basket.


8. **Place Tomato Sauce in Basket:** Steps 25-29. The robot releases the tomato sauce into the basket.
