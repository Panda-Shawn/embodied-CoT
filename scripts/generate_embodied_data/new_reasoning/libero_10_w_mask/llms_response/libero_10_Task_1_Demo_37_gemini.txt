## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the cream cheese box and the butter into a basket located on a table.  The cream cheese box and the butter are situated next to each other on the table. Other items—milk, orange juice, tomato sauce, and ketchup—are also present on the table, but are not relevant to the task. The robot needs to pick up the cream cheese box, place it in the basket, then pick up the butter and place it in the basket as well.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** This involves moving the robotic arm to the cream cheese box's location, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 0-18)
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** This involves moving the arm to the basket, placing the cream cheese box in the basket, and releasing the grip. (Steps 19-22)
3. **Pick up the butter:** This involves moving the robotic arm to the butter's location, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 23-30)
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** This involves moving the arm to the basket, placing the butter in the basket, and releasing the grip. (Steps 31-42)
