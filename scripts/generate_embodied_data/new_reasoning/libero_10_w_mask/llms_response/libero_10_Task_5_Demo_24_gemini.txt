1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy situated behind the book.  The environment also contained a white and yellow mug next to the book. The primary activity was manipulation of the book, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement        | Step Range | Justification                                                                   |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the book          | 0-4        | To position the robotic arm for grasping the book.                            |
| Grasp the book             | 5-8        | To secure the book for lifting and transportation.                            |
| Lift and move to the caddy | 9-11       | To clear the area and move the book towards the destination.                    |
| Position above the caddy   | 12-16      | To accurately align the book with the caddy's back compartment.                |
| Place the book in the caddy | 17-21      | To deposit the book into the designated location.                             |
