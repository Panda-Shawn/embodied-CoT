## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging two mugs onto specific plates.  The environment contained three mugs: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug.  Initially, the white mug was on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug was on the right plate. The red mug was not on a plate. The robot's objective was to leave the white mug on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate, which means it didn't actually move them.  The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal involved several steps, which can be categorized as follows:


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Pick up the yellow and white mug** | 4-15 |  The robot needs to pick up the yellow and white mug from the right plate to ensure that it's in the correct place as per instructions.  No movement of this mug is actually needed. This high-level movement serves to verify its location, which is implicitly part of the task. |
| **Place the yellow and white mug (verify location)** | 16-32 | The robot returns the yellow and white mug to its original position, confirming that it's already in the desired location. It needs to place it back down since it briefly held it. |
