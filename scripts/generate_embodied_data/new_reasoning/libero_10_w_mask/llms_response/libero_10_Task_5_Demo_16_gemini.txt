## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was situated on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was positioned such that its back compartment was accessible to the robot arm.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the book. (Steps 1-5)
2. **Pick up the book:**  The robot needed to grasp the book with its gripper. (Steps 6-9)
3. **Move to the caddy:** The robot needed to transport the book to the caddy. (Steps 11-16)
4. **Place the book in the caddy:** The robot needed to release the book into the back compartment of the caddy. (Steps 17-23)
