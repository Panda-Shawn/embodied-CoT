## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into the basket. The basket is located on a table or wooden surface, along with several other items: cream cheese (next to the basket), tomato sauce (next to the basket), ketchup (near orange juice), orange juice, milk, butter, and alphabet soup (already inside the basket).  The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation involving two objects. The intended outcome is to have both the alphabet soup (already present) and the tomato sauce inside the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and pick up the tomato sauce:** This involves moving towards the tomato sauce, grasping it with the gripper, and lifting it. (Steps 0-12, 13, 14)
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** This involves moving the grasped tomato sauce to the location of the basket and placing it inside. (Steps 15-20, 21-28)
3. **Stop:** The task is completed. (Steps 29-30)
