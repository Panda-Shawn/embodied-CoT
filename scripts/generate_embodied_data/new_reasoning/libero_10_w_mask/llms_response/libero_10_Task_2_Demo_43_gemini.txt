## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially located on the stove, and the stove was positioned on a table along with a chefmate frypan. The primary activity was manipulating the robot arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot. The intended outcome was to have the moka pot correctly positioned on the stove, ready for use.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot includes:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Moka Pot:** This involves moving the robotic arm towards the moka pot, positioning the gripper, and securely grasping the pot.  This corresponds to steps 1-5 in the trajectory.

2. **Lift and Rotate the Moka Pot:** The robot lifts the grasped moka pot to a height that allows it to be moved without obstruction and then rotates it to a position suitable for placement onto the stove. This covers steps 6-13.


3. **Position and Place the Moka Pot:** The robot moves the moka pot towards the stove and places it gently onto its surface. Steps 14-24 accomplish this.

4. **Retreat:** After placing the moka pot, the robot retracts its arm to a safe distance.  Steps 25-31 demonstrate this.

Note that there was no explicit "turn on the stove" action in this trajectory. Itâ€™s assumed that this was either not possible due to the robot's limitations or that the stove was already on.
