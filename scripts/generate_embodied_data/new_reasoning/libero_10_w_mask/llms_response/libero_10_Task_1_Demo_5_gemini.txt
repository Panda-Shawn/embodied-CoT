## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially located next to the basket on the table. The robot needed to grasp each item individually, lift it, and place it in the basket. This required a sequence of movements involving approaching each item, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the basket, placing it in the basket, releasing its grasp, and then repeating the process for the second item.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the cream cheese box:** (Steps 1-9)  This involved maneuvering to the cream cheese box's location and acquiring a firm grip.
2. **Lift and place the cream cheese box in the basket:** (Steps 10-16) This involved lifting the cream cheese box and depositing it into the basket.
3. **Approach and grasp the butter:** (Steps 17-24) This was similar to step 1, but focused on the butter.
4. **Lift and place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 25-31) This mirrors step 2 but for the butter.
5. **Return to a default position:** (Steps 32-41) The robot moves to a resting position after completing the task.
