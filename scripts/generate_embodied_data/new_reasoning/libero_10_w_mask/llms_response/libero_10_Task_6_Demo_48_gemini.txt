## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating two objects – a white mug and a chocolate pudding – in a specific arrangement on a table. The initial state showed a white mug on a plate, a red mug to the right of the plate, and the chocolate pudding on the floor. The goal was to move the white mug (already on the plate) and place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  This required the robot to grasp the pudding, move it to a designated location on the table to the right of the plate and release it.  The high-level movements were:

1. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involves positioning the robotic arm above the pudding, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 4-8)
2. **Move the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This phase consists of moving the grasped pudding across the table to the desired location. (Steps 9-24)
3. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This step involves releasing the pudding in the correct location. (Steps 25-31)
