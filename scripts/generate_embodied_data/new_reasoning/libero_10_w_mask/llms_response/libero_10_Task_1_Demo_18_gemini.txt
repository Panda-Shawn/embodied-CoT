## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing both a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially located next to each other on the table, close to the basket. The robot needed to pick up each item individually, transport it to the basket, and place it inside.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved:  approaching and picking up the cream cheese box, placing the cream cheese box in the basket, approaching and picking up the butter, and finally placing the butter in the basket.


High-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

1. **Pick up cream cheese box:** Steps 1-16. This movement was necessary to acquire the first object required for the task.  The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese box's location, grasp it securely, and lift it.

2. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 17-18. This movement was necessary to deposit the cream cheese box into the target location â€“ the basket.  This involved moving the arm to the basket and releasing the cream cheese box.

3. **Pick up butter:** Steps 19-25.  This movement was necessary to acquire the second object for the task.  The robot needed to navigate to the butter's location, grasp it, and lift it.

4. **Place butter in basket:** Steps 26-35. This movement was necessary to deposit the butter into the basket, completing the task.  This involved moving the arm to the basket and releasing the butter.
