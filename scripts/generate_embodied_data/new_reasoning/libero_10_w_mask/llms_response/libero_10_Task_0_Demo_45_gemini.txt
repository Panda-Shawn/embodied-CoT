### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves placing two cans, a can of alphabet soup and a can of tomato sauce, into a white wicker basket located on a table.  Other items on the table include cartons of orange juice, milk, butter, and cream cheese, as well as a bottle of ketchup. The cans are situated in front of the milk and orange juice cartons, which are themselves in front of the ketchup. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation requiring the robot to grasp each can individually, transport it to the basket, and release it inside. The intended outcome is both cans inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup can:** (Steps 0-12) This involves moving the arm to the can's location, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the alphabet soup can in the basket:** (Steps 12-17) This involves moving the grasped can to the basket and releasing it.
3. **Pick up the tomato sauce can:** (Steps 17-26) This involves moving the arm to the can's location, grasping it, and lifting it.
4. **Place the tomato sauce can in the basket:** (Steps 26-45) This involves moving the grasped can to the basket and releasing it.
