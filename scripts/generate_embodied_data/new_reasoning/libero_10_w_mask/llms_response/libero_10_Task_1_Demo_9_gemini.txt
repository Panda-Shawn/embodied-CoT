## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter and placing them into a basket located on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and the butter were situated next to each other on the table, amongst other items. The basket was also on the table. The robot needed to navigate to each item, grasp it, and then move it to the basket.  The general sequence involved picking up the cream cheese box first, placing it in the basket, then picking up the butter and placing it in the basket.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** Steps 0-18. This involved navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and then moving it to a safe intermediate location.


2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** Steps 19-30. This stage involved moving the cream cheese box to the basket and releasing it.


3. **Pick up the butter:** Steps 19-28. This involved navigating to the butter, grasping it, and moving it to a safe intermediate location.


4. **Place the butter in the basket:** Steps 29-37.  This involved moving the butter to the basket and releasing it.


5. **Stop:** Step 37. The task is complete.
