## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The primary activity was manipulating the stove and the moka pot to achieve the desired state: the moka pot sitting on the heated stove. The objects involved were a flat stove, a moka pot, and a chefmate frypan (which is irrelevant to the task). Initially, the moka pot was already on the stove, and the stove was off. The frypan was on the table, separate from the stove and moka pot.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach Stove and Turn On** | 1-10 | The robot needs to get into a position to interact with the stove's controls. This involves moving to the stove, and possibly adjusting its orientation to reach the controls. |
| **Grab Moka Pot** | 11-21 |  The robot must pick up the moka pot to reposition it. This involves moving to the moka pot, carefully grasping it, and preparing to lift it. |
| **Reposition Moka Pot** | 22-29 | The robot then moves the moka pot to ensure it's correctly centered on the stove. The action may also involve double-checking the placement. |
| **Release Moka Pot & Retreat** | 29-30 | The robot releases its grip on the moka pot, ensuring it's stable on the stove and then moves away. |
