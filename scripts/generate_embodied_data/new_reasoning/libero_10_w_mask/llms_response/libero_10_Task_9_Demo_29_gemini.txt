## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a yellow and white mug located on a counter and placing it inside a black microwave before closing the microwave door. The mug, microwave, and counter were all situated on a wooden surface (floor or table).  The robot needed to navigate to the mug, grasp it, move it to the microwave, place it inside, and then close the microwave door.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Mug:** Steps 0-12. The robot needed to approach the counter, position itself above the mug, and then grasp the mug using its gripper. This involved navigating to the correct location and orienting its end-effector appropriately.

2. **Transport the Mug to the Microwave:** Steps 13-22.  After grasping the mug, the robot moved the mug to the microwave, ensuring it maintained a stable grasp and kept the mug upright. This required careful maneuvering to avoid collisions and maintain the stability of the grip.

3. **Place the Mug in the Microwave and Close the Door:** Steps 23-36. The robot placed the mug inside the microwave and closed the door. This involved precision in placing the mug and then reaching and actuating the microwave door.
