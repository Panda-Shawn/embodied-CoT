## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially located on the stove, but the robot's task was to potentially move it and/or reposition it.  The stove and moka pot were situated on a table along with a chefmate frypan. The robot needed to interact with these objects to achieve the goal.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely included: approaching the stove, manipulating the stove's controls, and placing the moka pot on the stove in a stable position.  If the moka pot was already on the stove, a less complex sequence of actions could be required, as the robot only needed to confirm the pot's position and ensure the stove was on.


Here's a breakdown of the likely high-level movements:

1. **Approach Stove:** Steps 1-8. The robot moves to a position near the stove, preparing to interact with it.  This involves initial positioning and gripper preparation.

2. **Turn On Stove:** Steps 9-12 and Steps 24-26. This stage involves manipulating a control (assumed to be a rotary knob) to turn on the stove.  This may include initial rotation checking, turning the knob, and then releasing the grip.

3. **Adjust Moka Pot (If Needed):** Steps 13-23. This appears to be a conditional movement. It suggests the robot either repositions the moka pot or checks its position.

4. **Place Moka Pot (Confirmation):** Steps 27-38.  The robot confirms or adjusts the position of the moka pot to ensure it's properly placed on the stove.
