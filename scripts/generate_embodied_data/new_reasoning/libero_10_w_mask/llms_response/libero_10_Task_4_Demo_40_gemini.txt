## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging four mugs (one white, one yellow and white, and two red) and two plates on a surface.  The goal was to place the single white mug onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.  Initially, the mugs were positioned somewhat haphazardly. The high-level movements necessary to achieve this involved:

1. **Picking up the single white mug:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the white mug's location, grasping it, and then lifting it.  *(Steps 0-12)*
2. **Placing the single white mug on the left plate:** This involved moving the arm to the left plate's location and releasing the mug. *(Steps 12-19)*
3. **Picking up the yellow and white mug:** This involved moving the arm to the yellow and white mug's location, grasping it, and lifting it. *(Steps 19-32)*
4. **Placing the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** This involved moving the arm to the right plate's location and releasing the mug. *(Steps 32-38)*
