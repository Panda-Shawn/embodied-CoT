## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a cream cheese box and a stick of butter into a basket situated on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were initially located next to the basket on the table. The robot needed to grasp each item individually, lift it, and place it into the basket. The general sequence involved approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, placing it in the basket, then repeating the process for the butter.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the cream cheese box:** (Steps 0-9) The robot needs to navigate to the cream cheese box and secure it within its gripper.
2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** (Steps 10-19) The robot needs to move the cream cheese box to the basket and release it.
3. **Approach and grasp the butter:** (Steps 20-29) The robot needs to navigate to the butter and secure it within its gripper.
4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 30-40) The robot needs to move the butter to the basket and release it.
