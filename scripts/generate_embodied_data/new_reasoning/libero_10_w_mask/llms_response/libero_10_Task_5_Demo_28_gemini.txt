## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was positioned on the table with a white and yellow mug in front of it. The caddy was located behind the mug.  The primary activity was manipulation of objects, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Approaching the Book:** The robot needed to navigate to a position where it could reach the book without colliding with the mug.

2. **Picking up the Book:**  The robot had to grasp the book using its gripper.

3. **Moving to the Caddy:**  The robot needed to move the book to the caddy, accounting for the mug and other obstacles.

4. **Placing the Book:** The robot had to precisely position the book in the back compartment of the caddy.


Based on the trajectory, we can identify the following high-level movements and their corresponding steps:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approaching the Book | 0-3 | The robot needs to position itself to reach the book without hitting the mug.  Steps 0-2 involve maneuvering around the mug. Step 3 is a pause before grasping. |
| Picking up the Book | 4-7 | The robot lowers itself (4-5), closes its gripper (5-6) to grasp the book, and pauses (7) before lifting. |
| Moving to the Caddy | 8-16 | The robot lifts the book (8-9), moves to the general area of the caddy (9-11), and then adjusts its orientation and position (12-16) to prepare for placing the book. |
| Placing the Book | 15-17 | The robot carefully lowers the book into the caddy's compartment (15-16) and stops (17).|
