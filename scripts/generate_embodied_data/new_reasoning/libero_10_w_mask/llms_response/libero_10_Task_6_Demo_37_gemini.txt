## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a table to achieve a specific arrangement. The primary activity was rearranging two objects—a white mug and a chocolate pudding—relative to a plate.  The intended outcome was to have the white mug positioned on the plate and the chocolate pudding placed to the right of the plate.  The objects involved were a white mug, a plate (with the white mug initially on it), a chocolate pudding (initially to the right of the white mug), and a red coffee mug (to the right of the plate).

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** This high-level movement spans steps 0-8.  It was necessary because the white mug needed to be moved from its initial position on the plate to its final position on the plate (this may seem redundant, but the robot likely needed to re-grip it for a more stable placement).

2. **Place the white mug on the plate:** This high-level movement spans steps 9-16.  It was necessary to position the white mug accurately and securely onto the plate.

3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This high-level movement spans steps 17-26.  It was necessary to move the chocolate pudding to its final location to the right of the plate.

4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This high-level movement spans steps 27-29. It was necessary to position the chocolate pudding correctly in relation to the plate.
