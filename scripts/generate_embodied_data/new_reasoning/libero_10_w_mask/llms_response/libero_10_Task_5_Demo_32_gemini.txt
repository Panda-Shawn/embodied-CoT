## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, with a white and yellow mug positioned in front of it. The caddy was situated behind the mug. The primary activity was a two-part manipulation: grasping the book and then depositing it into the caddy's back compartment. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's designated location.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Book:** (Steps 1-8)  This movement involved positioning the robotic arm to reach the book, aligning its gripper, and securely grasping the book.  This was necessary to enable the subsequent movement of the book.

2. **Lift and Transport Book:** (Steps 9-19)  This phase involved lifting the grasped book clear of the table and transporting it towards the caddy, requiring adjustments in orientation and height to avoid collisions with the mug. This phase involved navigating around obstacles and safely moving to the caddy.

3. **Position and Deposit Book:** (Steps 20-35) This stage involved positioning the robotic arm over the back compartment of the caddy, carefully orienting the book for insertion, and releasing the gripper to deposit the book. This was crucial for successful placement within the designated area.
