1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a table to achieve a specific spatial arrangement. The primary activity was relocating a white mug and a chocolate pudding relative to a plate. The intended outcome was to have the white mug on the plate and the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  The objects involved were a white mug, a plate (with the white mug initially on it), a red coffee mug (to the right of the plate), and chocolate pudding (on the floor).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** This involved moving to the white mug, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-10)
2. **Place the white mug on the plate:** This involved moving the mug to the plate and releasing it. (Steps 11-17)
3. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involved moving to the pudding, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 18-29)
4. **Place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This involved moving the pudding to the desired location and releasing it. (Steps 30-35)
