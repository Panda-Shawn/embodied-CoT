## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to place both the cream cheese box and the butter into the basket. The environment includes a wooden table, a basket, a cream cheese box, a stick of butter, and other unspecified items. Initially, the cream cheese box and the butter are located on the table, separate from each other and the basket. The basket is presumably empty at the beginning.  The goal is to move both items from their positions on the table into the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the cream cheese box:** (Steps 0-16)  This involves navigating to the cream cheese box, grasping it, and lifting it.

2. **Place the cream cheese box in the basket:** (Steps 17-32) This involves moving the grasped cream cheese box to the basket and carefully depositing it inside.

3. **Pick up the butter:** (Steps 17-24) The robot navigates to the butter, grasps it, and lifts it.

4. **Place the butter in the basket:** (Steps 25-32)  This involves moving the grasped butter to the basket and releasing it.
