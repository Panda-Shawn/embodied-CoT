1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a yellow and white mug located on a counter and placing it inside a black microwave before closing the microwave door.  The mug, microwave, and counter were all situated on a table or floor. The primary activity was manipulation of the mug and microwave, with the intended outcome being the mug safely inside the closed microwave.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the mug:** (Steps 0-18) The robot needed to navigate to the mug's location, position its gripper appropriately, and securely grasp the handle.

2. **Transport the mug to the microwave:** (Steps 19-28)  The robot needed to carefully move the mug from the counter to the microwave's opening while maintaining a stable grip.

3. **Place the mug in the microwave:** (Steps 29-45)  This involves precise positioning of the mug within the microwave cavity to avoid damaging it or spilling its contents.

4. **Close the microwave:** (Steps 46-51) The robot needs to close the microwave door.
5. **Retreat:** (Implicit in the last steps - robot moves away from the microwave).
