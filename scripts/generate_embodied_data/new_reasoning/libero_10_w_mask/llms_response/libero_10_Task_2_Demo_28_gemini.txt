## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The moka pot was initially located on the stove, but likely not correctly positioned or the stove was off. The robot arm started some distance away from the stove and the moka pot.  The environment consisted of a wooden surface (table) with a chefmate frypan, a moka pot, and a flat stove. The frypan was irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was manipulating the robot arm to interact with the stove and moka pot. The intended outcome was to have the moka pot correctly positioned on the turned-on stove.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** (Steps 1-5) The robot needed to move its arm into a position where it could interact with the stove's controls and subsequently the moka pot.

2. **Turn on the stove:** (Steps 6-9)  The robot had to rotate the stove's control knob to turn it on.

3. **Grasp the moka pot:** (Steps 10-24) This involved positioning the gripper above the moka pot and securing it.

4. **Lift and reposition the moka pot:** (Steps 25-30) This moved the moka pot to its correct position on the stove.

5. **Adjust moka pot and release:** (Steps 31-39) This involved fine adjustments to the placement and release of the moka pot.
