## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The primary activity was manipulating the robot arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot, ultimately resulting in the moka pot being safely positioned on the stove's surface. The objects involved were a stove (located on the left side of a table), a moka pot (initially in the center of the table), and a chefmate frypan (on the right side of the table).  The robot needed to navigate to the moka pot, grasp it, move it to the stove, and then position it appropriately.


The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to move to the moka pot's location and securely grasp it using its gripper. This involved positioning itself correctly to avoid collisions.

2. **Move Moka Pot to Stove:** (Steps 8-17) After grasping the moka pot, the robot had to transport it to the stove's location.  This required careful movement to maintain a stable grip and avoid dropping the pot or colliding with other objects.  It might involve adjustments in orientation to ensure correct positioning on the stove.

3. **Position Moka Pot on Stove:** (Steps 18-27) This involved precisely placing the moka pot onto the stovetop surface.  This likely includes aligning the pot correctly and releasing it gently.

4. **Return to Home Position:** (Steps 28-39)  This final movement involves moving the robotic arm back to a default, safe position after completing the task. This is a crucial step in ensuring the robot doesn't obstruct the work area or pose a safety hazard.
