## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into a basket. The environment consisted of a table with a basket, cream cheese, tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, milk, butter, and alphabet soup. The basket was positioned on the table, with the cream cheese and tomato sauce located next to it.  Ketchup, orange juice, milk, and butter were arranged linearly next to each other, with ketchup closest to the cream cheese.  Initially, the alphabet soup was already in the basket.  The goal was to add the tomato sauce to the basket, leaving all other objects untouched.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** (Steps 1-8) The robot needed to approach the tomato sauce, position its gripper, and grasp the container.
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 9-16) The robot needed to move the grasped tomato sauce to the basket and release it.
3. **Stop:** (Steps 29-31) The robot completes the task and comes to a stop.
