## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task was to place both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce into the basket. The robot's environment included a basket, cream cheese, tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, milk, butter, and alphabet soup, all situated on a table. Initially, the alphabet soup was already in the basket, the cream cheese and tomato sauce were next to the basket, and other items were scattered elsewhere. The intended outcome was to have both the alphabet soup (already present) and the tomato sauce in the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** (Steps 2-12) This involved moving to the tomato sauce, grasping it, and lifting it.
2. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** (Steps 13-24) This involved moving the grasped tomato sauce to the basket and releasing it.
3. **(Implicit) Ensure the alphabet soup remains in the basket:** (Implicit throughout) The robot should avoid disturbing the alphabet soup already in the basket.
4. **Stop:** (Steps 24 onwards) The task is completed after placing the tomato sauce in the basket.
