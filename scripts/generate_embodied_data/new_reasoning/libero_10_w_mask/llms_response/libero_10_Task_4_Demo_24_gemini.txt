## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to rearrange two mugs on a table with two plates. The environment contains a wooden table, a white plate on the left, a red coffee mug on the right, a yellow and white mug in the middle, and a porcelain mug also on the right.  The goal is to place the white mug (assuming it's distinct from the yellow and white mug) onto the left plate and the yellow and white mug onto the right plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug:** This involves locating the white mug, moving the arm to its position, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-8)
2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** This involves moving the arm to the left plate, placing the mug, and releasing it. (Steps 9-18)
3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** This involves locating the yellow and white mug, moving the arm to its position, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 19-26)
4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** This involves moving the arm to the right plate, potentially adjusting its orientation, placing the mug, and releasing it. (Steps 27-37)
