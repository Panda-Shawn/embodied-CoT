1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black Akita bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained a white cabinet (left), a wine rack (right), a wine bottle (center), and the target Akita black bowl (inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet). The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, remove it, and then close the drawer.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach Cabinet:** (Steps 1-7) The robot needed to move towards the cabinet to reach the drawer. This involved navigating around other objects (wine bottle, wine rack).

2. **Open Drawer and Grasp Bowl:** (Steps 8-14) The robot needed to open the drawer and grasp the black bowl. This required precise positioning of the arm and careful manipulation of the gripper.

3. **Retrieve Bowl:** (Steps 15-17) The robot lifted the bowl from the drawer.

4. **Retreat and Close Drawer:** (Steps 18-26)  The robot moved away from the cabinet, while placing the bowl in a safe location, then returned to close the drawer.
