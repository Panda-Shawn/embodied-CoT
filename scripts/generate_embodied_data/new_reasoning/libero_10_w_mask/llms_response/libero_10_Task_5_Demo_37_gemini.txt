## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was situated such that its back compartment was accessible to the robot arm. The primary activity was manipulationâ€”grasping and transporting an object. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the book:** This involved navigating the robot arm to a position above the book, preparing for grasping.  (Steps 1-8)
2. **Grasp the book:** This involved lowering the arm, closing the gripper around the book, and lifting it. (Steps 9-13)
3. **Move to the caddy:** This involved moving the arm to the location of the caddy's back compartment. (Steps 15-21)
4. **Place the book:** This involved lowering the arm and opening the gripper to release the book into the caddy. (Steps 23-26)
