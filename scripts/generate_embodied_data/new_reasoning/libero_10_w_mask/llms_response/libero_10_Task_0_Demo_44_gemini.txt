## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their locations on a table to a basket, also situated on the table.  The basket was positioned on the table, with milk and orange juice cartons beside it, a ketchup bottle near the milk, a butter box next to the ketchup, and cream cheese near the butter box. The alphabet soup and tomato sauce were presumably located amongst these items (the exact placement is not specified, but inferred from the trajectory). The primary activity was picking up each item individually and placing it into the basket. The intended outcome was to have both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce safely inside the basket.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the alphabet soup:** Steps 1-13.  This was necessary to obtain the first of the two target objects.

2. **Place the alphabet soup in the basket:** Steps 14-19. This involved moving the soup to the basket's location and depositing it.

3. **Pick up the tomato sauce:** Steps 20-34. This involved acquiring the second target object.

4. **Place the tomato sauce in the basket:** Steps 35. This concluded the task by placing the second item in the basket.
