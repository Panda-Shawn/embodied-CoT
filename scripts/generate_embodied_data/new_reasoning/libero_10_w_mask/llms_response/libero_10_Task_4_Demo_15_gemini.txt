## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging three mugs – a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug – onto two plates.  The initial state showed the white mug already on the left plate and the yellow and white mug already on the right plate. The red mug was not on a plate. The robot's primary activity was to leave the mugs already on the plates untouched.  This implies the robot only needed to handle the red mug. The intended outcome was to have all three mugs arranged as they started: white mug on the left, yellow and white on the right, and red mug not on a plate.  This might seem redundant based on the instruction, but the robot's actions show this to be the case.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal involved approaching the red mug, picking it up, moving away from the plates (and therefore the other mugs), then setting it back down in a location not on either plate.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and grasp the red mug:** Steps 0-7.  This movement was necessary because the robot needed to pick up the mug to move it.
2. **Move away from the plates:** Steps 8-17.  This was necessary to avoid accidentally knocking over the other mugs while carrying the red mug.
3. **Place the red mug:** Steps 18-42.  This was necessary to complete the task of rearranging the mugs. The instruction states to move the mugs onto plates, but the implication of the environment and the robot's actions is that it should be moved to a place not on a plate.
