## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to rearrange objects on a table to achieve a specific configuration. The objects involved are a white mug, a plate, a chocolate pudding, and a red coffee mug. Initially, the white mug is on the plate, the chocolate pudding is to the right of the white mug, and the red coffee mug is to the right of the plate. The goal is to move the white mug (which is already on the plate) and place the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate.  This requires the robot to pick up the chocolate pudding, move it to the desired location, and then stop.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the chocolate pudding:** This involves approaching the pudding, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Move the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate:** This involves moving the arm with the pudding to the desired location. (Steps 5-14)
3. **Place the chocolate pudding down:** This involves releasing the pudding onto the table to the right of the plate. (Steps 15-16)
4. **Return to home position**: This involves moving the arm to a resting or neutral position. (Steps 17-26).
