## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book located on a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was positioned on the table next to a white and yellow mug. The caddy was situated nearby. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and control of the robotic arm. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the book from the table to the caddy's back compartment.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be inferred from the trajectory:

1. **Approach the book:** This involved moving the robotic arm to a position above the book, preparing for grasping.  (Steps 0-8)
2. **Grasp the book:** This involved positioning the gripper around the book and closing it to secure a grip. (Steps 9-11)
3. **Lift and transport the book:** This involved lifting the book from the table and moving it to the caddy. (Steps 12-19)
4. **Place the book in the caddy:** This involved positioning the book within the caddy's back compartment and releasing the grip. (Steps 20-23)
