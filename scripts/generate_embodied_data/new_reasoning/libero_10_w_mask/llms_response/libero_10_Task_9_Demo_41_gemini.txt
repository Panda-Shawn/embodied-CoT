## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a yellow and white mug from a counter to a microwave and then closing the microwave door. The environment consisted of a wooden surface (likely a table or counter), a yellow and white mug situated on the counter, a black microwave positioned next to the counter, and a gray counter.  The primary activity was the manipulation of the mug and the microwave. The intended outcome was the mug placed inside the microwave with the door closed.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Mug:** Steps 0-12.  The robot needs to approach the mug, position its gripper, and securely grasp the mug.

2. **Move Mug to Microwave:** Steps 13-19. The robot moves the grasped mug from the counter to the microwave's opening.

3. **Place Mug in Microwave:** Steps 20-24. The robot carefully places the mug inside the microwave.

4. **Release Mug and Close Microwave:** Steps 25-42. The robot releases the mug, and then closes the microwave door.
