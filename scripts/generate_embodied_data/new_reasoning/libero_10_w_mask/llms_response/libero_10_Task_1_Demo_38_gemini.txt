## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter and placing them into a basket situated on a table.  Other objects (tomato sauce, ketchup, orange juice, and milk) were present on the table, but irrelevant to the task. The cream cheese box and butter were positioned on the table near the basket.  The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it, lift it, and then move it to the basket. The general sequence of high-level movements involved:

1. **Grasping the Cream Cheese Box:** The robot first located and grasped the cream cheese box.
2. **Placing the Cream Cheese Box in the Basket:** The robot moved the cream cheese box to the basket and deposited it.
3. **Grasping the Butter:** The robot then located and grasped the butter.
4. **Placing the Butter in the Basket:**  Finally, the robot moved the butter to the basket and deposited it.


High-Level Movement Breakdown:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grasping the Cream Cheese Box   | 0-10       | To initiate the task, the robot needs to acquire the first object.                  |
| Placing Cream Cheese in Basket  | 11-19      | This moves the box from its initial location to the basket and releases it.      |
| Grasping the Butter             | 20-31      | The robot needs to acquire the second object.                                      |
| Placing Butter in the Basket    | 32-40      | This moves the butter from its initial location to the basket and releases it.    |
