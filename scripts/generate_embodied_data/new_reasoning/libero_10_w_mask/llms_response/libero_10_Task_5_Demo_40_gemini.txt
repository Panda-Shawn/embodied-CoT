## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black book from a wooden table and placing it in the back compartment of a desk caddy.  The book was located on the table, with a white and yellow mug positioned in front of it. The caddy was situated behind the mug. The primary activity was a two-phase manipulation:  first, grasping and lifting the book; second, transporting and placing the book into the caddy's back compartment.  The intended outcome was the successful relocation of the book from the table to the caddy.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Book (Steps 1-9):**  This involved navigating to the book's location, positioning the robotic arm appropriately, and grasping the book using the gripper.  This phase needed to be executed first because it's a prerequisite to moving the book.

2. **Lift and Transport to Caddy (Steps 11-17):**  After grasping the book, the robot needed to lift it, navigate around the mug, and move towards the caddy. This phase required careful maneuvering to avoid collisions.

3. **Place Book in Caddy (Steps 18-19):**  Finally, the robot had to precisely position the book within the caddy's back compartment and release its grip.  This is the final step to complete the task.
