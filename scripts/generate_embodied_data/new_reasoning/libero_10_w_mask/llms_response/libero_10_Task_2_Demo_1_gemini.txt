## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a stove and placing a moka pot on it.  The environment consisted of a flat stove, a chefmate frypan sitting on the stove, and a moka pot on the table next to the stove. The primary activity was to manipulate the robot arm to achieve the desired state: the moka pot placed on the stove. The intended outcome was a safe and successful transfer of the moka pot from the table to the stovetop.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the moka pot:** This involves navigating the robot arm to the moka pot's location, precisely positioning the gripper, and securely grasping the handle. (Steps 1-8)
2. **Lift and transport the moka pot:** This involves lifting the moka pot from the table, navigating around potential obstacles (the frypan on the stove), and positioning it above the stovetop. (Steps 9-22)
3. **Place the moka pot on the stove:** This involves carefully lowering the moka pot onto the stovetop, ensuring stable placement and releasing the grip. (Steps 23-38)
