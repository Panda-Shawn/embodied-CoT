## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring both the alphabet soup and the tomato sauce from their locations on a table to a white wicker basket also situated on the table.  Other items present on the table included a carton of orange juice, a carton of milk, a carton of butter, a bottle of ketchup, and a small carton of cream cheese. The milk and orange juice were near the basket, the butter next to the milk, the ketchup and tomato sauce next to the butter, and the cream cheese next to the ketchup. The alphabet soup was also located on the table.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Pick up alphabet soup:** (Steps 0-14)  This involved moving to the alphabet soup's location, grasping it, and then moving away to a temporary holding position. This was necessary to isolate the action of picking up one item at a time to avoid collisions or dropping either item.

2. **Place alphabet soup in basket:** (Steps 14-23) This involved moving to the basket's location and placing the soup inside. This was necessary to fulfill the first part of the task instruction.

3. **Pick up tomato sauce:** (Steps 23-33)  This involved moving to the tomato sauce's location, grasping it, and then moving away.  Similar to step 1, this was to ensure a controlled grasp.

4. **Place tomato sauce in basket:** (Steps 33 onwards) This involved moving to the basket's location and placing the tomato sauce inside. This completed the task requirement of placing both items in the basket.
