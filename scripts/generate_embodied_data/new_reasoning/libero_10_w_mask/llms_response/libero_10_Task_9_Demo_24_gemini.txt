## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing a specific mug—a yellow and white mug—into a microwave and closing the microwave door.  The environment contained this target mug, a second porcelain mug, a microwave, and a flat surface (likely a table or countertop). The yellow and white mug was initially positioned in front of the microwave, while the porcelain mug was elsewhere on the surface.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Yellow and White Mug:** (Steps 0-11)  The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position to grasp the mug without colliding with other objects. This involved careful movement and orientation adjustments.

2. **Place the Mug in the Microwave:** (Steps 12-18) After grasping the mug, the robot had to transport it to the microwave's interior, requiring precise movement to avoid dropping the mug or hitting the microwave's interior.

3. **Close the Microwave Door:** (Steps 19-23)  Once the mug was inside, the robot needed to close the microwave's door.

4. **Retreat to a Safe Position:** (Steps 24-42)  Finally, the robot retracted to avoid obstructing the microwave and to maintain a safe operating distance and posture.
