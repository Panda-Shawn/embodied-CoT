## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robotic arm to grasp each moka pot individually, lift it, and then place it on the stove. The intended outcome was to have both moka pots situated on the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the First Moka Pot (Steps 0-7):** The robot needed to navigate to the first moka pot, position itself correctly, and securely grasp the pot using its gripper. This involved moving to a suitable location above the pot, positioning precisely, and then closing the gripper around the pot.

2. **Lift and Place the First Moka Pot on the Stove (Steps 8-16):**  The robot had to lift the grasped moka pot, move it over to the stove, and then carefully place it down.  This involved upward movement, precise translocation, and opening the gripper to release the pot.

3. **Approach and Grasp the Second Moka Pot (Steps 17-23):**  This stage mirrored the first, involving navigation, precise positioning above the second moka pot, and closing the gripper to secure it.

4. **Lift and Place the Second Moka Pot on the Stove (Steps 24-32):** This stage is similar to step 2 and involved lifting, precise movement to the stove, and carefully placing down the second moka pot.
