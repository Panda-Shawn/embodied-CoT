## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring two moka pots from an unspecified location to a stove.  The primary activity was manipulation and placement, with the intended outcome being both moka pots resting securely on the stove. The objects involved were two moka pots and a stove, all situated on a flat surface (table or floor). The general sequence of high-level movements involved: picking up the first moka pot, placing it on the stove, picking up the second moka pot, and placing it on the stove.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** Steps 0-17. This was necessary to initiate the task and move the first moka pot from its initial position to a position ready for placement on the stove.
2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** Steps 18-39. This movement was crucial for completing the first half of the task, ensuring the first moka pot is correctly positioned on the stove.
