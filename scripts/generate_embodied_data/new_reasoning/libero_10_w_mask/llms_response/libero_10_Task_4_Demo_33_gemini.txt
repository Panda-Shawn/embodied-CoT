## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging three mugs on a table: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red mug. The white mug initially rested on the left plate, and the yellow and white mug was on the right plate. The red mug was in the center. The goal was to maintain the position of the white mug on the left plate but move the yellow and white mug to the right plate.  This required the robot to pick up the yellow and white mug, carefully move it to the right plate, and place it down without disturbing other mugs.

The robot likely followed a plan consisting of these high-level movements:

1. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** (Steps 6-8) This involves moving to the mug, adjusting position, and then closing the gripper to secure the mug. This happens at the initial location of the yellow and white mug.

2. **Move the yellow and white mug to the right plate:** (Steps 9-20) This involves a series of movements to transport the mug from its initial position to the designated right plate, ensuring a stable grasp throughout the movement.

3. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** (Steps 19-20) This involves opening the gripper and moving slightly to avoid collision with the plate.


4. **Pick up the white mug (from the left plate):** (Steps 24-28)  This is a similar process to picking up the yellow and white mug, ensuring the gripper is adjusted for a secure grasp.

5. **Move the white mug to the left plate:** (Steps 29-32) This movement is shorter than the previous move since the mug is already on the correct plate. The trajectory shows that the gripper is opened, which is a redundancy but can be interpreted as the robot refining its approach.

6. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** (Steps 33-44) The white mug is placed correctly on the left plate, completing the task.
