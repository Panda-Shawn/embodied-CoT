## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring two moka pots from an unspecified location to a stove.  The intended outcome was to have both moka pots resting securely on the stove's surface. The objects involved were two moka pots and a stove, all situated on a flat surface (floor or table).

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the first moka pot:** This involved approaching the first pot, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 1-17)
2. **Place the first moka pot on the stove:** This involved moving the grasped pot to the stove and carefully placing it down. (Steps 18-25)
3. **Pick up the second moka pot:** This involved repeating the pick-up process for the second pot. (Steps 26-34)
4. **Place the second moka pot on the stove:** This involved moving the second pot to the stove and placing it down. (Steps 35-37)
