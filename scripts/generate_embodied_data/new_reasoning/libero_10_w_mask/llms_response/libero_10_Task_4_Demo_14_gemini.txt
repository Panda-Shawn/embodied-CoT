## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involves manipulating three mugs and two plates on a table to achieve a specific arrangement.  The primary activity is the relocation of mugs to designated plates. The intended outcome is to have the white mug on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate.

The objects involved are: a white plate (left), a red coffee mug (right), a yellow and white mug (center), a porcelain mug (right), and a right plate (right).

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal can be broken down as follows:

**High-Level Movements:**

1. **Pick up the white mug:** This involves approaching the white mug, grasping it, and lifting it.  (Steps 1-7)
2. **Place the white mug on the left plate:** This involves moving the grasped white mug to the left plate and releasing it. (Steps 8-17)
3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug:** This involves approaching the yellow and white mug, grasping it, and lifting it. (Steps 18-24)
4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate:** This involves moving the grasped yellow and white mug to the right plate and releasing it. (Steps 25-32)
5. **Stop:** The task is completed. (Steps 33)
