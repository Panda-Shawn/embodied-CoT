## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially positioned on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove which was also on the same surface.  The robot needed to pick up each moka pot individually, transport it to the stove, and carefully place it down. The general sequence of high-level movements consisted of: approaching the first moka pot, picking it up, moving it to the stove, placing it down, repeating the process for the second moka pot, and then finishing the task.


The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach and grasp the first moka pot:** Steps 0-18. This involved navigating to the first moka pot, orienting the gripper, closing the gripper to secure the pot.

2. **Move the first moka pot to the stove and place it down:** Steps 19-26. This involved moving the grasped pot to the stove's vicinity, readjusting its position and opening the gripper to place the pot.

3. **Approach and grasp the second moka pot:** Steps 27-32. Similar to step 1, but now for the second moka pot.

4. **Move the second moka pot to the stove and place it down:** Steps 33-45.  Similar to step 2, but now for the second pot, carefully positioning it on the stove.
