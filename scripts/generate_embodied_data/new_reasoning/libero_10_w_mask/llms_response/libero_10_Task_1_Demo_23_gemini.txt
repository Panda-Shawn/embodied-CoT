## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up both the cream cheese box and the butter and placing them into a basket located on a wooden table.  The cream cheese box and butter were situated next to the basket on the table. The robot needed to navigate to each item, grasp it, and then move it to the basket. The general sequence involved approaching the cream cheese box, picking it up, moving it to the basket, placing it in the basket, then repeating the process for the butter.


The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Pick up cream cheese box:** Steps 0-9. This movement was necessary to acquire the first object, making it available for placement in the basket.

2. **Place cream cheese box in basket:** Steps 10-16. This movement was necessary to deposit the first object into the target location.

3. **Pick up butter:** Steps 17-25.  This movement was necessary to acquire the second object.

4. **Place butter in basket:** Steps 26-33. This movement was necessary to deposit the second object into the target location, completing the task.
