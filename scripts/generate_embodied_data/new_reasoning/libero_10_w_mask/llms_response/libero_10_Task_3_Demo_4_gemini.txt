## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black Akita bowl from the bottom drawer of a white cabinet and then closing the drawer.  The environment contained a white cabinet on the left, a wine rack in the middle, a wine bottle on the right, and the target Akita black bowl inside the bottom drawer of the cabinet. All objects were situated on a wooden surface (floor or table). The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach and Open Cabinet:** The robot needed to approach the cabinet, potentially navigating around other objects (wine rack and bottle), and then open the cabinet drawer. (Steps 1-16)

2. **Retrieve the Bowl:** Once the drawer was open, the robot had to reach into the drawer, grasp the black bowl, and carefully lift it out. (Steps 17-24)

3. **Move Bowl to a Safe Place:** The robot would then move the grasped bowl to a temporary safe location to avoid collision before proceeding to place it where it needs to be.  (Step 25-30)

4. **Place the Bowl (and potentially relocate temporarily):** The robot would then move the bowl to its destination, place it carefully in a designated safe position. (Steps 31-33)


5. **Close the Cabinet Drawer:** Finally, the robot would close the cabinet drawer. (Step 34)
