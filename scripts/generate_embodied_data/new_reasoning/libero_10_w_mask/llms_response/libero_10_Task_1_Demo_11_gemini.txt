## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a cream cheese box and a stick of butter from a table and placing them both into a basket.  The cream cheese box and butter were located next to each other on a wooden table, among other items such as milk, orange juice, and tomato sauce. The robot needed to navigate to each object, grasp it carefully, lift it, move to the basket, and place the object in the basket before repeating the process for the second object.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the cream cheese box, grasping it, moving it to the basket, releasing it, then repeating the same sequence of movements for the butter.

The identified high-level movements are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Cream Cheese Box:** Steps 0-10. This was necessary to acquire the first object for placement in the basket. The robot needed to navigate to the cream cheese box and position its gripper for a successful grasp.

2. **Move Cream Cheese Box to Basket:** Steps 11-20. After grasping the cream cheese box, the robot needed to transport it to the basket. This involved a trajectory change to maneuver around other objects on the table.

3. **Approach and Grasp Butter:** Steps 22-33. This is the same action repeated for the second object in the task.

4. **Move Butter to Basket:** Steps 34-40.  The robot moves the butter to the basket, following a similar trajectory to the cream cheese box.

5. **Final Stop:** Steps 41-42. The robot finishes the task.
