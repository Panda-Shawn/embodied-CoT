## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove.  The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface. The primary activity was the manipulation of the robotic arm to grasp each pot individually, lift it, and carefully place it on the stove. The intended outcome was two moka pots securely positioned on the stove. The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the first moka pot, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the stove, placing it on the stove, repeating the process for the second moka pot, and finally returning to a resting position.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements identified from the trajectory:

1. **Approach and Grasp First Moka Pot:** Steps 1-17. This movement was necessary to get the robot's gripper close enough to the first pot to pick it up. It involves positioning and orienting the arm and closing the gripper.

2. **Lift and Place First Moka Pot on Stove:** Steps 18-26.  After grasping the first pot, this movement involves lifting the pot, navigating the arm to the stove, and placing it down gently.

3. **Approach and Grasp Second Moka Pot:** Steps 27-43. Similar to the first pot, this movement involves approaching and grasping the second pot, using a different path due to the presence of the first pot already on the stove.

4. **Lift and Place Second Moka Pot on Stove:** Steps 44-56. This is the final placement of the second moka pot onto the stove.  It includes adjusting the orientation to ensure stable placement and opening the gripper.
