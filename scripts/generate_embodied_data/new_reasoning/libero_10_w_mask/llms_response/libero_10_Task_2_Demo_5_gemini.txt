## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved turning on a flat stove and placing a moka pot onto it.  The stove and moka pot were initially located on a table, with the moka pot already positioned on the stove.  The frypan was also present on the table, but not involved in the task. The primary activity was manipulating the robotic arm to interact with the stove and the moka pot. The intended outcome was to have the moka pot securely positioned on the stove, ready for use.

The high-level movements that were likely followed are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Moka Pot:** (Steps 1-9)  This involved moving the robotic arm to the location of the moka pot, positioning its gripper, and securely grasping the handle of the moka pot.  This was necessary to be able to move the moka pot.

2. **Lift and Rotate Moka Pot (Minor Adjustment):** (Steps 10-14) This involved lifting the moka pot slightly, possibly to adjust its orientation before placing it back down in a more optimal position on the stove.  This may have been needed to correct the pot's position to sit optimally on the stove burner

3. **Place Moka Pot on Stove:** (Steps 15-24) This involved moving the robotic arm to the stove and carefully placing the moka pot onto the stovetop.  This was necessary to complete the core part of the task and the reason for the previous high-level movements.

4. **Release and Retreat:** (Steps 25-33) This involved releasing the grip on the moka pot and moving the robotic arm away from the stove and moka pot. This was the final stage and ensures that the robot does not interfere with the operation of the stove or the moka pot.
