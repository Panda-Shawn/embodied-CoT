## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved placing two moka pots onto a stove. The moka pots were initially located on a surface (table or floor), separate from the stove, which was also on the same surface.  The primary activity was a pick-and-place operation, requiring the robot to grasp each pot individually, lift it, and carefully position it on the stove. The intended outcome was two moka pots securely placed on the stove.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and Grasp the First Moka Pot:**  (Steps 0-19) The robot moved to the first moka pot, positioned its gripper, grasped the pot, and lifted it slightly.

2. **Place the First Moka Pot on the Stove:** (Steps 20-29) The robot carefully moved the first pot over to the stove and positioned it.

3. **Approach and Grasp the Second Moka Pot:** (Steps 30-41)  The robot moved to the second moka pot, repeated the grasping procedure.

4. **Place the Second Moka Pot on the Stove:** (Steps 42-42) The robot moved the second pot to the stove and positioned it.
