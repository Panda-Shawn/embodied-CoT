## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved rearranging three mugs on a table: a white mug, a yellow and white mug, and a red coffee mug.  The goal was to place the white mug on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate.  The initial state showed the white mug already on the left plate and the yellow and white mug on the right plate.  The red mug was not on a plate.  Therefore, the actual task was implicitly to leave the white mug and yellow and white mug in place and to ignore the red coffee mug.  The robot successfully achieved this by not disturbing the existing placement of the target mugs.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Pick up the white mug (Steps 0-10):**  The robot needed to verify the placement of the white mug to ensure the task was already complete for this mug.  No action was needed.

2. **Place the white mug on the left plate (Steps 11-15):** No action needed as the mug was already correctly positioned.

3. **Pick up the yellow and white mug (Steps 16-31):** The robot needed to verify the placement of the yellow and white mug to ensure the task was already complete for this mug. No action was needed.

4. **Place the yellow and white mug on the right plate (Steps 32-39):** No action was needed as the mug was already correctly positioned.
