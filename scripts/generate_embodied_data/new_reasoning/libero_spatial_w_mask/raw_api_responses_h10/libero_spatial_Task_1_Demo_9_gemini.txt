## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate situated on the floor.  The environment included several distractors: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a flat stove, and cookies on a table. The primary activity was a manipulation task, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from its initial position to the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

* **High-Level Movement 1: Approach and Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 0-4): The robot needed to navigate to the black bowl, position itself correctly for grasping, and then secure the bowl in its gripper. This involved initial positioning, careful downward movement towards the bowl, and finally the closure of the gripper to firmly hold the bowl.

* **High-Level Movement 2: Lift and Transport the Bowl** (Steps 5-9): After grasping the bowl, the robot needed to lift it clear of the table and begin moving it towards the plate's location. This required an upward movement, followed by repositioning to prepare for transport towards the plate.

* **High-Level Movement 3: Position and Place the Bowl** (Steps 10-14):  The robot needed to carefully position itself above the plate, and precisely lower the bowl to place it onto the plate.  This involved a vertical movement down, and then opening the gripper to release the bowl.

* **High-Level Movement 4: Retract** (Steps 15-16): The robot needed to retract its arm after placing the bowl, preparing for any subsequent tasks.
