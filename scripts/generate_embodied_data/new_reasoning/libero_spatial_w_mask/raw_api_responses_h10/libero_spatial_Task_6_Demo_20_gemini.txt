1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and placing it on a plate.  The environment contained several objects: a black bowl, a cookie box, a plate, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin. The black bowl was positioned adjacent to the cookie box, while the plate was situated on a surface (floor or table). The other objects were present but not directly relevant to the task.  The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve the goal included: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving to the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate.

High-level movements identified:

+ **Approach Bowl:** Steps 0-5. This was necessary to bring the robotic arm into position to grasp the bowl.  The robot needed to navigate to the location of the bowl without colliding with other objects.

+ **Grasp Bowl:** Steps 5-6. This involved closing the gripper around the bowl to secure it.  Securely holding the bowl is critical to successfully completing the lifting and placement.

+ **Lift and Move to Plate:** Steps 7-12. This involved lifting the bowl vertically, and then possibly moving horizontally to the plate's location. This stage requires careful coordination to avoid dropping the bowl.

+ **Place Bowl:** Steps 13-16. This involved lowering the bowl to the plate and releasing it.  Precise placement prevents the bowl from falling or tipping.
