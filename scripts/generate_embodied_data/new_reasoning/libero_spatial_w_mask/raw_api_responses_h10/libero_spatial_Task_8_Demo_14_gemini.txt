## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl situated next to a plate and placing it onto the plate.  The environment contained several objects: a black bowl, a plate with cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove, all on a wooden surface. The goal was to manipulate the black bowl, leaving the other objects undisturbed. The robot needed to navigate to the bowl, grasp it carefully, lift it, and then move it to a position above the plate before gently placing it down.


The robot's high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl:** Steps 0-9. The robot needs to approach the bowl, orient itself correctly to grasp the bowl, and then close its gripper. This involves navigating around obstacles and precisely positioning itself for a successful grasp.


2. **Lift and Transport Bowl:** Steps 10-14.  This movement focuses on lifting the bowl once it's grasped, and moving it towards the plate, while maintaining a stable grasp. This requires careful upward motion and controlled movement to prevent dropping the bowl or colliding with the environment.

3. **Place Bowl on Plate:** Steps 15-20. Here, the robot needs to position itself above the plate, carefully lower the bowl onto the plate, and release its grasp. This segment is crucial for ensuring the bowl is placed correctly on the plate without damage.
