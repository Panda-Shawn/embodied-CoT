## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located on the stove and placing it onto a plate situated on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table. The black bowl was the target object, and its location on the stove was crucial information. The plate, the destination for the bowl, was located on the floor.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely involved:  approaching the stove, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving to the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate.


The high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps are:

1. **Approach Stove and Grasp Bowl:** Steps 0-4. This involved positioning the robot arm to reach the black bowl on the stove and securely grasp it using the gripper.  This is necessary to initiate the pick-up phase.

2. **Lift Bowl and Move to Plate:** Steps 5-12. This involved lifting the bowl from the stove, navigating around any obstacles, and moving towards the location of the plate on the floor. This is the main transport phase.

3. **Place Bowl on Plate:** Steps 13-19.  This involved lowering the bowl onto the plate and releasing the bowl.  This is the deposition phase.
