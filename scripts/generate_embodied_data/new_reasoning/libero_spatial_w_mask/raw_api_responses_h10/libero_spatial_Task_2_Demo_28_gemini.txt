## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located in the center of a table and placing it onto a plate.  The environment contained several objects: a black bowl, a plate, cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove.  Crucially, the black bowl was initially on the table (near the stove), and the plate was also on the table. The cookies were on the ramekin. The goal was to move the bowl from the table to the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** This involved navigating to the location of the black bowl on the table.  (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the bowl:**  The robot needed to position its gripper over the bowl and securely grasp it. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot lifted the bowl to a safe height to avoid collisions. (Steps 6-7)
4. **Move to the plate:** The robot moved the grasped bowl to the position of the plate. (Steps 8-11)
5. **Position and release the bowl:** The robot positioned the bowl over the plate and released its grip. (Steps 12-14)
6. **Retreat:** The robot moved away from the bowl and plate. (Steps 15)
