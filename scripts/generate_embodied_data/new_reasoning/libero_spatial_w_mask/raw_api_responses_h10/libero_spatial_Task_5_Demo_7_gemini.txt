## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl situated on a ramekin and placing it onto a nearby plate.  The environment consisted of a wooden table or floor containing the black bowl (on the ramekin), a plate, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove. The relative positions were such that the robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach the bowl and then the plate. The general sequence of high-level movements included: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving to the plate, and placing the bowl onto the plate.


Based on the trajectory, the high-level movements are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl:** Steps 0-5. This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the bowl to grasp it securely. The robot needed to navigate around any obstacles to reach the bowl.

2. **Lift Bowl:** Steps 6-10.  Lifting the bowl required a precise movement to avoid knocking over the ramekin or the bowl itself while maintaining a secure grip.

3. **Move to Plate:** Steps 11-24. This involved navigating the robot's arm to the plate, avoiding collisions with other objects on the table.

4. **Place Bowl on Plate:** Steps 25-31. This required a controlled lowering of the bowl onto the plate, opening the gripper to release it and then retracting the arm.
