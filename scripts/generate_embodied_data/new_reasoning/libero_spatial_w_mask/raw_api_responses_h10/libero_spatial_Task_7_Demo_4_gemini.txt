## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from a stove and placing it onto a plate on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table. The relevant objects were the black bowl (on the stove), and the plate (on the floor). The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach and grasp the bowl:** This involved moving the robotic arm to the stove, positioning it above the bowl, and closing the gripper to secure the bowl.  (Steps 1-6)
2. **Lift and reposition the bowl:** After grasping the bowl, the robot needed to lift it clear of the stove and prepare for movement toward the plate. (Steps 7-10)
3. **Navigate to the plate:**  This involved maneuvering around other objects (cabinet, etc.) to reach the plate's location. (Steps 11-16)
4. **Place the bowl on the plate:** This involved positioning the bowl above the plate and opening the gripper to release it. (Steps 17-19)
