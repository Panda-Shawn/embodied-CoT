## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl from the center of a table and placing it onto a plate. The table also contained cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and a flat stove.  A wooden cabinet was situated next to the table. The primary activity was manipulation of the black bowl, with the intended outcome being its relocation from its initial position on the table to the plate.

The high-level movements the robot likely followed are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl:** (Steps 0-5) The robot needed to move towards the black bowl located at the table center, position its gripper above the bowl, and then grasp it securely. This was necessary to initiate the object manipulation aspect of the task.

2. **Lift and Transport Bowl:** (Steps 6-10) After grasping the bowl, the robot had to lift it clear of the table, and then move it towards the plate. This movement was essential for safely transporting the object without collision.

3. **Position and Release Bowl:** (Steps 11-16)  The robot needed to manoeuvre the bowl above the plate, carefully lower it, and release its grip. This ensured accurate placement of the bowl onto the target location.
