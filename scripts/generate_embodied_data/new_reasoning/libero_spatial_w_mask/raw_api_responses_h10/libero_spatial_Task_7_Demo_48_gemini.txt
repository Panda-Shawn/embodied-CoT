## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a black bowl located on the stove and place it on a plate situated on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table.  The black bowl was the target object, clearly identifiable by its color and location. The plate was the designated destination.  The robot needed to navigate around these distractor objects to successfully complete the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves maneuvering the robotic arm to a position near the stove where the black bowl is located.  *(Steps 0-2)*

2. **Grasp the black bowl:** This stage involves positioning the gripper above the bowl and then closing the gripper to secure a hold. *(Steps 3-4)*

3. **Lift and move the bowl:** This requires lifting the bowl from the stove and carefully transporting it to the plate, avoiding collisions with other objects. *(Steps 5-14)*

4. **Place the bowl on the plate:**  The robot needs to position the bowl above the plate and release its grip to gently place it down. *(Steps 15-18)*

5. **Return to a resting position:** After placing the bowl, the arm returns to a neutral position. *(Steps 19-21)*
