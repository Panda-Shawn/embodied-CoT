## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate.  The environment contains several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and cookies on a table.  The relevant objects are the black bowl (target object), the ramekin (landmark for bowl location), and the plate (target destination). The bowl and ramekin are presumably on a surface, and the plate is on the floor.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:**  This involves navigating to the general vicinity of the bowl, using the ramekin as a visual cue.  *(Steps 0-2)*.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** This includes moving the robotic arm downwards to reach the bowl and closing the gripper to secure a hold. *(Steps 3)*.
3. **Lift the bowl:**  The robot lifts the bowl from its resting position. *(Steps 4-6)*.
4. **Move to the plate:** The robot moves the bowl to the location of the plate. *(Steps 7-8)*.
5. **Place the bowl:** The robot lowers the bowl onto the plate and releases its grip. *(Steps 9-12)*.
