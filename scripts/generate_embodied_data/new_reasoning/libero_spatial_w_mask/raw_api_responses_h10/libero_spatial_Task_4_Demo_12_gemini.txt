## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved retrieving a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it onto a plate located on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a plate with cookies on it (the target placement location), a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and a flat stove on a table. The black bowl was the only object in the top drawer.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet to access the drawer.

2. **Open the drawer and grasp the bowl:** (Steps 4-10) This involved reaching into the drawer, manipulating the drawer's mechanism to open it (if necessary), locating the black bowl, and grasping it with its gripper.

3. **Lift the bowl out of the drawer:** (Steps 11-12) After grasping the bowl, the robot needed to lift it clear of the drawer.

4. **Retreat from the cabinet:** (Steps 13-16) To avoid collision and provide a clear path for the next stage, the robot moved away from the cabinet.

5. **Approach the plate and position above it:** (Steps 16-18) The robot needed to navigate towards the plate to place the bowl.

6. **Place the bowl on the plate:** (Steps 19-20) This stage involved carefully lowering the bowl onto the plate and releasing its grip.

7. **Stop:** (Steps 21) The task was completed.
