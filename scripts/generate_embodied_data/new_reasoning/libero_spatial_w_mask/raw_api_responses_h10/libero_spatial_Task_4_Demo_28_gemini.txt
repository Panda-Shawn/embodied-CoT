## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it onto a plate located on the floor. The environment contained several distractor objects: a glazed rim porcelain ramekin and a flat stove, both on the floor, alongside the target plate. The black bowl was the only object inside the top drawer of the wooden cabinet.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** (Steps 0-2) The robot needs to position itself in front of the cabinet to access the drawer.

2. **Open the drawer and grasp the bowl:** (Steps 3-6)  The robot needs to open the top drawer and pick up the black bowl using its gripper.

3. **Lift the bowl out of the drawer:** (Steps 7-8) Once grasped, the bowl needs to be carefully lifted out of the drawer.

4. **Move to the plate:** (Steps 9-11)  The robot then needs to navigate to the location of the plate on the floor.

5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** (Steps 12-14) Finally, the robot needs to release the bowl onto the plate.
