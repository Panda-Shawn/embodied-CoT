## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a black bowl from its current position on a plate (located somewhere in the center of the table) to a new location on the plate.  The environment contained several other objects: cookies on a ramekin, a wooden cabinet near a flat stove, all situated on the table. The primary activity was manipulation of the bowl, requiring precise movements to grasp and relocate it without disturbing other items.


The high-level movements are:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl (Steps 0-8):** This phase involved moving the robotic arm to the bowl's location and securely grasping it. The arm initially needs to navigate to the general table area, then more precisely to the bowl's position, and finally execute a grip action.

2. **Lift and Transport Bowl (Steps 9-13):** Once the bowl was grasped, the arm needed to lift it safely, then move it to the designated drop-off location (the plate, seemingly already in position) without collision.

3. **Release and Withdraw (Steps 14-17):** After transporting the bowl, the arm opened its gripper above the plate's surface to release the bowl, then safely retracted.
