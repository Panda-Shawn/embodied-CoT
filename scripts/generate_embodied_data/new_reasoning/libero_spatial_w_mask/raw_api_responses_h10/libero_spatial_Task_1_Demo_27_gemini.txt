## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included a black bowl, a ramekin, a plate, a wooden cabinet, and a stove. The bowl and ramekin were situated close together, while the plate was located at some distance. The primary activity was a two-phase manipulation: grasping the bowl and then transporting it to the plate's location. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from its initial position to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements was likely:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needed to move itself into a position suitable for grasping the bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot had to reach the bowl, close its gripper, and securely hold the bowl.
3. **Lift and transport the bowl:** The robot needed to lift the bowl, navigate around potential obstacles (cabinet, stove), and move towards the plate.
4. **Place the bowl on the plate:** The robot had to position the bowl above the plate, and release its grip to place the bowl down.


High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the bowl             | 0-2        | Positioning the robot arm close enough to the bowl for grasping.                                     |
| Grasp the bowl                | 3-4        | Achieving a firm grip on the bowl using the gripper.                                              |
| Lift and transport the bowl   | 5-11       | Lifting the bowl, moving it towards the plate while avoiding obstacles.                            |
| Place the bowl on the plate   | 12-14      | Positioning the bowl and releasing the grip.                                                       |
