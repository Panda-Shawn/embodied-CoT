1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included a black bowl, a cookie box, a plate, a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin. The bowl and cookie box were situated relatively close together, while the plate was located elsewhere (on the floor or a table). The other objects were present in the environment but were not directly involved in the task.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** This involved navigating to the vicinity of the black bowl and the cookie box. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** This involved reaching down, and precisely positioning the gripper to securely grasp the bowl. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the bowl:** This involved lifting the bowl up clear of the table or floor. (Steps 5-7)
4. **Move to the plate:** This involved navigating to the location of the plate. (Steps 8-10)
5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** This involved lowering and carefully orienting the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 11-15)
6. **Release the bowl:**  This involved opening the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 15-16)
7. **Retract:**  This involved moving away from the plate. (Step 17)
