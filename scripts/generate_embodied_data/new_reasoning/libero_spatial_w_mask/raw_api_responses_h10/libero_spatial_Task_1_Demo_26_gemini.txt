## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black bowl situated next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate located on the floor.  The environment included several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a flat stove, and cookies on a table. The primary activity was manipulation, with the intended outcome being the successful transfer of the bowl from its initial location to the plate. The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve the goal was:

1. **Approach the bowl:** Move the robotic arm to a position close enough to grasp the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:**  Position the gripper and close it to secure the bowl.
3. **Lift the bowl:** Raise the bowl to clear it from its resting position.
4. **Transport the bowl:** Move the bowl to the vicinity of the plate.
5. **Place the bowl:** Position the bowl above the plate and release the gripper.
6. **Retreat:** Move the robotic arm away from the bowl and plate.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding steps in the trajectory:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the bowl | 0-3 | The robot needs to position itself near the bowl before grasping it. This involves maneuvering around potential obstacles. |
| Grasp the bowl | 3-4 | This involves precisely positioning the gripper and activating it to securely hold the bowl.  |
| Lift the bowl | 5-7 | The robot needs to lift the bowl to clear its original position next to the ramekin.  |
| Transport the bowl | 8-11 |  The robot moves the bowl towards the plate, avoiding obstacles and maintaining a stable grip. |
| Place the bowl | 11-16 | This involves carefully positioning the bowl above the plate and then releasing it. |
| Retreat | 16-20 | After placing the bowl, the robot moves away to avoid interfering with the newly placed bowl. |
