## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and place it on a plate.  The environment includes several other objects: a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, all located on the floor or a table. The relevant objects for this task are the black bowl, the cookie box (providing the bowl's location), and the plate (the destination). The high-level movements required are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl (Steps 0-4):** The robot needs to navigate to the bowl, position itself correctly, and grasp the bowl using its gripper.

2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl (Steps 5-7):**  Once grasped, the robot needs to lift the bowl and move it to the plateâ€™s location.  A rotation might be necessary to avoid obstacles during transport.

3. **Place the Bowl (Steps 8-14):** The robot needs to position the bowl over the plate and carefully release it. This might involve adjustments to ensure stable placement.

4. **Retreat (Steps 14-15):** The robot retracts to a safe distance after successfully placing the bowl.
