## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the stove and placing it on a plate located on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet near a table holding a glazed rim porcelain ramekin. The primary activity was a two-stage manipulation: first, grasping the black bowl; second, transporting and releasing it onto the plate.  The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from the stove to the plate without damaging any objects or the environment.


The robot likely followed a plan consisting of three high-level movements:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** This movement spans steps 0-6.  The justification is that the robot must first navigate to the bowl's location on the stove and then execute the grasping action.

2. **Transport the Bowl:** This movement spans steps 7-14. The robot needs to lift the bowl, maneuver around any obstacles, and move towards the plateâ€™s location.

3. **Release and Depart:** This movement spans steps 15-18. The robot must carefully position the bowl on the plate, release its grip, and then move away to conclude the task.
