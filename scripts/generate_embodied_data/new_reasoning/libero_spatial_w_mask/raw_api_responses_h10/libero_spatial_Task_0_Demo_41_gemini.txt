## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a surface to rearrange them according to a specific instruction. The primary activity was to move a black bowl from its initial position between a plate and a ramekin to a new position on top of the plate.  The intended outcome was the black bowl resting on the plate. The objects involved were a black bowl, a plate, a ramekin, cookies (irrelevant to the task), and a wooden cabinet (also irrelevant). The black bowl was located between the plate and the ramekin. The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve the goal was:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needed to maneuver its arm into a position where it could grasp the bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot had to accurately position its gripper and close it around the bowl.
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot needed to lift the bowl vertically, ensuring a secure grip.
4. **Move the bowl to the plate:** The robot had to transport the bowl to the plateâ€™s location.
5. **Position the bowl on the plate:**  The robot needed to place the bowl carefully onto the plate.
6. **Release the bowl:** The robot needed to open its gripper to release the bowl onto the plate.
7. **Retract:** The robot needs to move away from the plate.


Based on the trajectory features, the high-level movements can be mapped as follows:

| High-Level Movement       | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the bowl          | 0-2        | Position the arm for grasping.                                                      |
| Grasp the bowl            | 3-6        | Lower the arm and close the gripper around the bowl.                               |
| Lift the bowl             | 7-10       | Raise the bowl vertically.                                                          |
| Move the bowl to the plate | 11-14      | Transport the bowl towards the plate; possible minor adjustments for positioning. |
| Position the bowl on the plate | 14-15     | Precisely position the bowl above the plate                                       |
| Release the bowl          | 16-19      | Open the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate.                               |
| Retract                   | 20         | Move the arm away from the plate.                                                  |
