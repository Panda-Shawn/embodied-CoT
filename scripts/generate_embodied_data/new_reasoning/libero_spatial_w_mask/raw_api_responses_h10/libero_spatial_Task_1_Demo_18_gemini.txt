## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included a black bowl, a ramekin, a plate, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove. The bowl and ramekin were positioned together, while the plate was situated at some distance. The robot needed to navigate around other objects (cabinet, stove) to reach the bowl, pick it up, and then navigate to the plate's location to place it down.  The primary activity was object manipulation, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bowl from its initial location to the plate.

The robot likely followed these high-level movements:

1. **Approach the bowl:** (Steps 0-3) The robot needed to move to a position where it could grasp the bowl. This involved navigating around any obstacles and reaching the appropriate location relative to the bowl and ramekin.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** (Steps 3-4)  Once in position, the robot had to close its gripper to secure the bowl.

3. **Lift the bowl:** (Steps 4-7) After grasping the bowl, the robot lifted it clear of the table or floor.

4. **Move to the plate:** (Steps 7-11) The robot then moved to the plate's location while carrying the bowl, avoiding obstacles.

5. **Position over the plate:** (Steps 11-13)  Before placing the bowl, the robot needed to position itself directly above the plate.

6. **Place the bowl:** (Steps 13-17) Finally, the robot tilted and opened its gripper to gently release the bowl onto the plate.
