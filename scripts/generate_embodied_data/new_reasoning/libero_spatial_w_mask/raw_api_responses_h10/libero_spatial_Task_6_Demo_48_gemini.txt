### 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black bowl situated next to a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  All objects were located on a table or floor, alongside a wooden cabinet and a stove. The robot needed to navigate to the bowl, grasp it without disturbing other objects, lift it carefully, and then transport it to the plate, placing it gently.  The high-level movements involved:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** (Steps 0-6) The robot needed to approach the bowl, positioning itself for a stable grasp. This involved navigating obstacles and adjusting its orientation to correctly align with the bowl's handle or a suitable grasping point.

2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl:** (Steps 7-16)  After grasping the bowl, the robot had to lift it carefully, maintaining a secure grip and avoiding collisions.  This phase involved vertical movement and possibly slight adjustments to maintain balance.

3. **Place the Bowl on the Plate:** (Steps 17-27) This involved moving the bowl to the plate's location, precisely positioning it, and then carefully releasing it onto the plate.

4. **Retreat:** (Step 27) The robot would finish the task by moving to a safe distance after placing the bowl on the plate.
