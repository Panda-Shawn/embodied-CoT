## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves manipulating objects in a cluttered environment to achieve a specific goal: transferring a black bowl from a cookie box to a plate. The environment contains a black bowl situated on top of a cookie box, a plate located on the floor, a wooden cabinet, and a stove, all positioned on a table.  The primary activity is the transportation of the bowl, and the intended outcome is the successful placement of the black bowl onto the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the cookie box:** The robot needs to navigate to the location of the cookie box to reach the bowl.  This involves maneuvering around potential obstacles (cabinet, stove).
2. **Pick up the bowl:** Once positioned near the cookie box, the robot must grasp the bowl securely using its gripper. This requires precise positioning above the bowl and careful manipulation of the gripper.
3. **Transport the bowl:** After securing the bowl, the robot must carry it to the target location—the plate on the floor—without dropping it. This involves maintaining stability during movement.
4. **Place the bowl on the plate:**  The robot needs to gently lower the bowl onto the plate, ensuring it is placed correctly and doesn't fall. This requires careful positioning and controlled movement.


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the cookie box | 0-4 | To get close enough to the bowl for grasping. The robot avoids obstacles by moving around the table strategically. |
| Pick up the bowl | 5-9 |  To grasp the black bowl securely. This involves moving down, carefully adjusting position and closing the gripper. |
| Transport the bowl | 10-13 | To move the bowl from the cookie box to the plate on the floor. The robot holds the bowl safely. |
| Place the bowl on the plate | 14-18 | To carefully release the bowl onto the plate. A controlled downward and slight leftward movement assists in placing it on the plate. |
