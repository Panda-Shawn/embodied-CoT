## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it on a plate. The environment includes a black bowl, a ramekin, a plate, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove.  The black bowl and ramekin are positioned together, while the plate is situated elsewhere in the workspace (likely on a table or the floor). The robot needs to navigate to the bowl, grasp it, lift it, move it to the plate, and release it. The high-level movements are as follows:


| High-Level Movement         | Step Range | Justification                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the black bowl     | 0-3         | The robot needs to position itself to reach the bowl.                                    |
| Grasp the black bowl       | 3           | The gripper needs to be closed to secure the bowl.                                     |
| Lift the black bowl        | 4-6         | The robot must lift the bowl to clear the surface.                                      |
| Navigate to the plate       | 6-10       | The robot must move to the plate's location.                                          |
| Position above the plate    | 10-11       | The robot must position the bowl accurately over the plate before releasing.           |
| Release the black bowl      | 12-13       | The gripper must be opened to release the bowl onto the plate.                       |
| Final Stop                 | 14          | The task is complete.                                                              |
