## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from a wooden cabinet and placing it onto a plate on the floor.  The environment included a black bowl situated on a wooden cabinet, a plate on the floor, along with several distractor objects (a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, cookies, and a flat stove) also on the floor.  The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring the robotic arm to successfully grasp the bowl, lift it, transport it across the space, and gently place it on the designated plate, avoiding any collisions with the surrounding objects. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bowl from the cabinet to the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement         | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the cabinet         | 0-3        | To position the arm for grasping the bowl.                                       |
| Grasp the bowl              | 4-8        | To secure the bowl for lifting and transport.                                  |
| Lift and transport the bowl  | 9-11       | To move the bowl clear of the cabinet and towards the plate.                   |
| Approach the plate          | 12-16      | To position the bowl above the plate for placement.                              |
| Place the bowl on the plate | 17-18      | To release the bowl onto the plate.                                              |
| Retract                     | 19-20      | To move the arm away from the plate, completing the task.                       |
