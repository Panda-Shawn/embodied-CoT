## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved transferring a black bowl from a wooden cabinet to a plate on the floor.  The environment included a black bowl positioned on a wooden cabinet, a plate on the floor, along with several distractor objects (a flat stove, cookies, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin). The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, grasp the bowl, lift it, move it to the plate, and carefully place the bowl onto the plate.  The high-level movements necessary to achieve this goal were:

1. **Approach and Grasp Bowl:** Steps 0-9.  This involved navigating the robot arm to the bowl's location on the wooden cabinet, positioning the gripper, and securely grasping the bowl.

2. **Lift and Transport Bowl:** Steps 10-12. This phase included lifting the bowl clear of the cabinet and then initiating the movement towards the plate on the floor.

3. **Place Bowl on Plate:** Steps 13-18. This final stage involved carefully maneuvering the bowl above the plate and then releasing it gently onto the plate.
