## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the stove and placing it on a plate located on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table, all irrelevant to the task. The black bowl was positioned on the stove, and the plate was on the floor. The robot needed to navigate around other objects to reach the bowl, pick it up, and then navigate to the plate to deposit the bowl.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the stove:** Steps 0-2.  This movement was necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the stove to reach the black bowl.

2. **Pick up the bowl:** Steps 3-5. This movement involved reaching the bowl and securely grasping it using the gripper.

3. **Lift and move above the stove:** Steps 6-10.  Lifting the bowl clear of the stove was crucial to avoid collisions during transport.

4. **Navigate to the plate:** Steps 11-18. This involved maneuvering around potential obstacles (likely the cabinet and table) to reach the plate's location on the floor.

5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** Steps 19-22. This involved carefully releasing the bowl onto the plate.
