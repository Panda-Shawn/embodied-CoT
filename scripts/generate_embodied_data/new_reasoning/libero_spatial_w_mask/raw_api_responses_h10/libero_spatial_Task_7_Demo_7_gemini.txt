## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black bowl located on a stove and placing it on a plate situated on the floor.  The environment also contained a wooden cabinet, a porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table, but these were irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was the manipulation of the black bowl, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from the stove to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the stove, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving to the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate.


| High-Level Movement            | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the stove              | 0-2        | To position the robot arm within reach of the black bowl on the stove.              |
| Grasp the black bowl           | 2-4        | To securely hold the bowl for lifting and transport.                               |
| Lift the black bowl             | 4-8        | To raise the bowl clear of the stove for safe transport.                           |
| Move to the plate              | 8-12       | To transport the bowl to the designated drop-off location.                         |
| Position above the plate        | 12-13      | To align the bowl directly over the plate for precise placement.                   |
| Place the black bowl on the plate | 13-16      | To release the bowl onto the plate, completing the task.                             |
