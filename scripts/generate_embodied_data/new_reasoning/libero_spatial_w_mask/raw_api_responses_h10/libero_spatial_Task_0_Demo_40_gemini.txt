## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a surface to rearrange them according to a specific instruction. The primary activity was to pick up a black bowl and place it on a plate. The objects involved were a black bowl, a plate, cookies (irrelevant to the task), a ramekin, and a wooden cabinet (also irrelevant).  The black bowl was situated between the plate and the ramekin on a wooden surface. The intended outcome was to have the black bowl resting on the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needed to maneuver itself into a position where it could grasp the bowl. (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot needed to accurately position its gripper and close it around the bowl. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot needed to lift the bowl clear of the surface. (Steps 7-12)
4. **Move the bowl to the plate:** The robot needed to transport the bowl to the plate's location. (Steps 13-15)
5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** The robot needed to carefully lower the bowl onto the plate and release its grip. (Steps 16-19)
