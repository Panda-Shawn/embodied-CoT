## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a plate containing cookies and placing it onto the same plate.  The environment included a wooden floor/table, a black bowl, a plate with cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove. The relative positions were crucial: the black bowl was adjacent to the plate.  The goal was to manipulate the bowl's position, not its orientation.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** This involved navigating to the bowl's vicinity.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** This encompassed positioning the gripper above the bowl and closing it to secure a grip. (Steps 4-7)
3. **Lift the bowl:** This stage involved lifting the bowl clear of the table. (Steps 8-10)
4. **Move to the plate:** This stage involved moving the bowl over the plate. (Steps 11-13)
5. **Lower the bowl onto the plate:** This stage involved carefully placing the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 14-16)
6. **Release the bowl:** This involved opening the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 16-17)
7. **Retreat:** This was a final movement to clear the area. (Steps 18-21)
