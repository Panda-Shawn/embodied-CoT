1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located between a plate and a ramekin and placing it onto the plate.  All objects were situated on a flat surface (table or floor), along with a wooden cabinet and a stove, which were irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and grasping. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bowl from its initial position to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl to the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate, then returning to a resting position.

Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:

| High-Level Movement             | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the bowl                | 0-4         | Position the robotic arm to reach the bowl, considering its location between the plate and the ramekin.            |
| Grasp the bowl                  | 5-8         | Lower the arm and close the gripper to securely hold the bowl.                                                    |
| Lift the bowl                   | 9-10        | Raise the arm vertically, lifting the bowl from the table.                                                     |
| Move bowl towards the plate     | 11-14       | Move the bowl horizontally towards the plate, potentially adjusting orientation.                                 |
| Position bowl above the plate   | 15-18       | Carefully lower the bowl to the desired position above the plate.                                               |
| Place bowl on the plate         | 19-22       | Open the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate.                                                              |
| Return to resting position      | 23-24       | Move the arm back to its initial position or a default resting state.                                        |
