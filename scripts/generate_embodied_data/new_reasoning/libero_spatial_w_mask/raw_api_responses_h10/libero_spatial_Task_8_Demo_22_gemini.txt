## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black bowl situated next to a plate and place it onto the plate.  The environment contains several objects on a surface: a black bowl, a plate with cookies on it, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and a wooden cabinet. The black bowl is positioned adjacent to the plate. The primary activity is the manipulation of the bowl, and the intended outcome is to have the black bowl resting on the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl to the plate, and placing the bowl on the plate.


The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach Bowl:** Steps 0-5. This movement is necessary to position the robotic arm in close proximity to the black bowl to facilitate grasping.

2. **Grasp Bowl:** Steps 6-8.  This movement is crucial for securely holding the bowl during transportation.

3. **Lift Bowl:** Steps 9-11. This movement raises the bowl to provide sufficient clearance for maneuvering to the plate.

4. **Move to Plate:** Steps 12-14.  This movement transports the bowl from its initial location to a position above the plate.

5. **Place Bowl on Plate:** Steps 15-17. This movement involves carefully lowering the bowl onto the plate.

6. **Retreat:** Steps 18-20. This movement moves the arm away from the plate after successfully placing the bowl.
