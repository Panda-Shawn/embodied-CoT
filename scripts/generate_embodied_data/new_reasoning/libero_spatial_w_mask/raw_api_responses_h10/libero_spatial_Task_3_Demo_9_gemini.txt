## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black bowl located on top of a cookie box and place it onto a plate.  The environment includes a black bowl (target object), a cookie box (supporting object), a plate (destination), a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin. The bowl sits on the cookie box, which is presumably on a surface (table or floor), along with the stove and cabinet. The plate is also on the same surface.  The robot needs to navigate to the bowl, grasp it without disturbing other objects, lift it, move it to the plate, and carefully place it down.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the cookie box:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needs to get close enough to the cookie box to reach the bowl.

2. **Pick up the bowl:** (Steps 4-8)  The robot needs to grasp the bowl firmly enough to lift it without dropping it.

3. **Lift the bowl:** (Steps 6-8) The robot needs to lift the bowl vertically to clear the cookie box.

4. **Move to the plate:** (Steps 15-18) The robot must move the bowl to the position above the plate.

5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** (Steps 18-22) The robot must carefully position the bowl on the plate and release it.
