1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task was to pick up a black bowl located in the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and place it on a plate situated on the floor.  The environment also contained cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and a flat stove, but these were irrelevant to the task. The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, close the drawer, navigate to the plate, and finally place the bowl on the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to the cabinet:** (Steps 0-4)  The robot needed to move into a position where it could interact with the cabinet.
2. **Open the drawer and grasp the bowl:** (Steps 5-13) The robot had to reach the drawer, open it, locate the bowl, and securely grasp it.
3. **Close the drawer and lift the bowl:** (Steps 14-17) The robot had to close the drawer to avoid obstacles and lift the bowl clear of the cabinet.
4. **Navigate to the plate:** (Steps 18-23)  The robot had to move to the location of the plate, avoiding obstacles.
5. **Place the bowl on the plate and return:** (Steps 24-28) The robot had to release the bowl onto the plate and then return to a safe stop position.
