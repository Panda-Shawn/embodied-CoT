## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it onto a plate located on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: cookies and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin on a table, and a flat stove also on the table. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movements to open the drawer, grasp the bowl, and then move it to the designated plate. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from its initial location within the cabinet to the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot can be broken down as follows:


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the cabinet | 0-1 | The robot needs to get close enough to the wooden cabinet to interact with it. |
| Open the top drawer | 2-4 | Access to the black bowl requires opening the top drawer. |
| Grasp the black bowl | 3-4 | The robot needs to secure the bowl with the gripper to lift it. |
| Lift the bowl out of the drawer | 5-7 | The bowl needs to be lifted above the drawer to be moved.  |
| Navigate to the plate | 8-12 | The robot needs to move the bowl to the plate's location. |
| Place the bowl on the plate | 13-14 | The final action is to release the bowl onto the plate. |
