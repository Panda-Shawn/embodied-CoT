1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included several objects: a black bowl, a cookie box (to which the bowl is adjacent), a plate (located on the floor or table), a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin. The primary activity was a two-stage manipulation: grasping and lifting the bowl, and then transporting and releasing it onto the target plate.  The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from its initial location to the plate.  The general sequence involved approaching the bowl, grasping it, lifting it clear of the surface, moving it to the plate, and then releasing it.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

+ **High-Level Movement 1: Approach and Grasp the Bowl** (Steps 0-4)
    + *Range:* Steps 0-4
    + *Justification:* This phase involves navigating to the bowl's location and securely grasping it with the gripper. This is necessary before the bowl can be lifted and moved.

+ **High-Level Movement 2: Lift and Transport the Bowl** (Steps 5-7)
    + *Range:* Steps 5-7
    + *Justification:*  The bowl must be lifted to a safe height to clear any obstacles and to allow for unimpeded movement to the plate. This movement enables the transport of the bowl.

+ **High-Level Movement 3: Approach and Place the Bowl** (Steps 8-13)
    + *Range:* Steps 8-13
    + *Justification:* This phase involves moving to the plate's location and precisely releasing the bowl. This completes the transfer.
