## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves manipulating objects on a surface. The primary activity is to pick up a specific black bowl located between a plate and a ramekin and then place it onto the plate.  The intended outcome is to have the black bowl resting on the plate, with the cookies remaining on the plate.  The objects involved are a black bowl, a plate (containing cookies), a ramekin, and potentially other items (wooden cabinet, flat stove) which are irrelevant to the task. The black bowl's position is crucial; it's situated between the plate and the ramekin, allowing the robot to approach it from either side.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be described as follows:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needs to navigate to a position where it can grasp the bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot needs to accurately position its gripper and securely grasp the bowl.
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot needs to lift the bowl to a safe height, clear of the surrounding objects.
4. **Move the bowl to the plate:** The robot needs to transport the bowl to the plate while keeping it stable and preventing collisions.
5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** The robot needs to lower the bowl onto the plate and release its grip.


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the bowl | 1-6 |  The robot needs to move into a position above and close to the black bowl to reach it with its gripper.  This involves several forward and slightly sideways movements to avoid obstacles. |
| Grasp the bowl | 7-9 | The robot needs to move vertically downwards to precisely position its gripper and then close the gripper to secure the bowl.  |
| Lift the bowl | 11-13 | The robot lifts the bowl to a safe height to avoid collisions with the plate, ramekin, or other objects during transport. |
| Move the bowl to the plate | 14-16, 17-19 | These steps involve repositioning to move from the starting point to an optimal location for placing the bowl on the plate, then adjusting. |
| Place the bowl on the plate | 20-31 | The robot needs to move the bowl over the plate. Then it performs several downward movements and finally opens the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate.  Rotational adjustment is involved. |
