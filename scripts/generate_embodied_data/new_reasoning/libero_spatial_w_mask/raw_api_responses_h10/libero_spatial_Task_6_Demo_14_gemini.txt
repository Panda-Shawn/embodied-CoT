## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl situated next to a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included several other objects: a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, all of which were irrelevant to the task. The primary activity was manipulation of the bowl, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bowl from its initial position to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements required to achieve this goal involved: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl to the plate, and releasing the bowl onto the plate.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements identified from the trajectory:

| High-Level Movement          | Step Range | Justification                                                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the black bowl      | 0-3         | The robot needs to get close enough to the bowl to grasp it.                       |
| Grasp the black bowl        | 3-7         | The robot needs to secure a grip on the bowl before lifting.                       |
| Lift the black bowl         | 8-11        | The robot needs to raise the bowl clear of the table or floor.                     |
| Move the black bowl to plate | 12-18       |  The robot must navigate to the location of the plate.                           |
| Place the black bowl on plate | 19-21       | The robot needs to carefully release the bowl onto the plate.                       |
| Finish                     | 22-23      | Robot finishes any minor adjustments and reports completion of task.     |
