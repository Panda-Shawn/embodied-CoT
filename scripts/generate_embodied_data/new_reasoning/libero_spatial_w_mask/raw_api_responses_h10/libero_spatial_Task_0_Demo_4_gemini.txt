## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects on a surface to rearrange them according to a specific instruction. The primary activity was to relocate a black bowl from its initial position between a plate and a ramekin to a new position on top of the plate. The objects involved were a black bowl, a plate, a ramekin, cookies (which are irrelevant to the task), and a wooden cabinet (also irrelevant).  The bowl's initial position was centrally located between the plate and the ramekin. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl onto the plate.


The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal can be broken down as follows:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needed to navigate to the vicinity of the black bowl, positioning itself appropriately for grasping. (Steps 1-5)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot had to accurately grasp the bowl using its gripper. (Steps 6-7)
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot lifted the bowl from the surface. (Steps 8-11)
4. **Move to the plate:** The robot moved the grasped bowl to the desired position above the plate. (Steps 12-14)
5. **Place the bowl:** The robot carefully placed the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 15-19)
6. **Retreat:** The robot moved away from the objects to a safe position. (Steps 20)
