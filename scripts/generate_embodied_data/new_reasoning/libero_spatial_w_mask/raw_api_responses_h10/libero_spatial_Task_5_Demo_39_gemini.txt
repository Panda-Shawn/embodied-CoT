## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located on a ramekin and placing it onto a nearby plate.  The environment consisted of a wooden table or floor upon which the black bowl (on a ramekin), a plate, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove were situated. The relative positions were such that the robot needed to navigate around the cabinet and stove to reach the bowl and then the plate. The primary activity was the manipulation of the bowl, and the intended outcome was the successful transfer of the bowl from the ramekin to the plate without damaging any of the objects.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach the bowl:** This movement involved navigating the robot to a position where the gripper could grasp the bowl.  This spanned steps 0-6. The justification is that the robot needs to be positioned correctly before it can interact with the bowl.  The cabinet and stove are obstacles that needed to be navigated around to reach the bowl.

2. **Grasp the bowl:**  This movement involved aligning the gripper, rotating to an appropriate orientation, and closing the gripper to securely hold the bowl. This spanned steps 6-7. The justification is that the robot must securely grasp the bowl before lifting it.

3. **Lift the bowl:** This movement involved vertically moving the bowl up to clear the ramekin. This was accomplished in steps 7-10. This is necessary to lift the bowl off its current resting point without obstructions.

4. **Move to the plate:**  This involved moving the bowl to a location above the plate. This spanned steps 10-14. This is required to position the bowl directly above its target location, the plate.

5. **Place the bowl:** This involved positioning the bowl over the plate, tilting and opening the gripper to release it. This spanned steps 14-20. The robot needs to gently lower the bowl onto the plate without dropping it or damaging it.

6. **Retreat:** This involved moving the arm away from the plate after placing the bowl.  This spans steps 20-21. This action is a safety measure to prevent any potential collisions with the plate or other objects after completing the task.
