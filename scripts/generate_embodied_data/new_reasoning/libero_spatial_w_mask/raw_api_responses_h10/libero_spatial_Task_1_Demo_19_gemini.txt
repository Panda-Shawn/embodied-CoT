## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved manipulating objects in a kitchen-like environment to relocate a black bowl.  The primary activity was to pick up a specific black bowl located next to a ramekin and place it onto a plate situated on the floor.  The relevant objects were: a black bowl (target object), a ramekin (nearby landmark), a plate (destination), a wooden cabinet, a stove, and cookies (irrelevant distractors). The bowl and ramekin were presumably on a surface above the plate.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the bowl:** This involved navigating to the general vicinity of the black bowl. (Steps 0-2)
2. **Grasp the bowl:** This included precise maneuvering to position the gripper over the bowl and then closing the gripper to secure the bowl. (Steps 3-4)
3. **Lift the bowl:** This involved raising the bowl to a safe height, clearing it from its original location. (Steps 5-7)
4. **Move to the plate:** The robot transported the bowl to the plate's location. (Steps 8-10)
5. **Place the bowl:** This involved lowering the bowl onto the plate and releasing it. (Steps 11-13)
