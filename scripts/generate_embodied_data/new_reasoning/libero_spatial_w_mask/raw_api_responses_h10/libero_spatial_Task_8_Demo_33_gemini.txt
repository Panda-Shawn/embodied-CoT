1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a plate and placing it onto the same plate.  The bowl and a plate containing cookies were situated on a wooden surface, alongside other objects like a ramekin, wooden cabinet, and stove. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movement and object recognition. The intended outcome was the relocation of the black bowl from its initial position beside the plate to a position on top of the plate.

The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement           | Step Range | Justification                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the black bowl       | 0-3        | To position the robotic arm close enough to grasp the bowl.                                                 |
| Grasp the black bowl          | 4-6        | To securely hold the bowl for lifting and relocation.                                                        |
| Lift and move the black bowl   | 7-10       | To lift the bowl and start moving it towards the plate.                                                    |
| Position above the plate     | 11-13      | To align the bowl directly above the plate for placement.                                                   |
| Carefully place the black bowl | 14-17      | To gently place the bowl on the plate, avoiding any accidental spills or damage to the cookies or the bowl. |
| Stop                         | 18         | To signal the task's successful completion.                                                                  |
