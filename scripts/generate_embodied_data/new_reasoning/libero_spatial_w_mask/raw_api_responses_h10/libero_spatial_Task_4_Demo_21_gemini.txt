## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it on a plate.  The environment contained several objects: a wooden cabinet with a top drawer holding the target black bowl, a plate, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and cookies. The robot needed to navigate to the cabinet, open the drawer, grasp the bowl, carefully extract it, and finally, place it on the plate.  Ignoring the other objects, the robot successfully completed this task.


The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Navigate to the cabinet:** (Steps 0-2)  The robot needed to position itself appropriately to interact with the cabinet.

2. **Open the cabinet drawer:** (Steps 3-7) The robot needed to approach the drawer, orient itself correctly, and then open it by applying force.

3. **Grasp the black bowl:** (Steps 7-8) The robot needed to reach into the drawer and grip the black bowl securely.

4. **Lift and extract the bowl:** (Steps 9-11) The robot needed to lift the bowl out of the drawer, avoiding collisions.

5. **Move to the plate:** (Steps 12-16) The robot had to navigate from the cabinet to the location of the plate.

6. **Place the bowl on the plate:** (Steps 16-18) The robot needed to position itself above the plate and carefully release the bowl.

7. **Stop:** (Steps 18-19) The robot had finished the task.
