## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a black bowl, which is currently situated on a ramekin, and place it onto a nearby plate.  The environment includes a wooden table or floor upon which the bowl, ramekin, plate, a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove are located.  The bowl and ramekin are positioned such that the robot must maneuver around potential obstacles to reach them and then to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves: approaching the bowl, grasping the bowl, lifting the bowl, moving the bowl to the plate, and placing the bowl onto the plate.


The high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** Steps 0-12.  This movement is necessary to position the robotic arm close enough to the bowl to securely grasp it.  This involves navigating around potential obstacles and adjusting the arm's orientation for optimal gripping.

2. **Lift the Bowl:** Steps 13-15.  This movement raises the bowl from the ramekin, clearing it from the surface.

3. **Move the Bowl to the Plate:** Steps 16-26. This movement transports the grasped bowl to the vicinity of the plate.

4. **Place the Bowl on the Plate:** Steps 27-29. This involves precisely positioning the bowl above the plate and releasing it.
