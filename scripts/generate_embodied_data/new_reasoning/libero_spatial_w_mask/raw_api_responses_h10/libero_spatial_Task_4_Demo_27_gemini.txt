## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from the top drawer of a wooden cabinet and placing it onto a plate located on the floor.  The environment contained several distractor objects: cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, and a flat stove, all on the floor. The primary activity was manipulation of the bowl, with the intended outcome being its successful transfer from the drawer to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements likely followed by the robot included:

1. **Approach the cabinet:** The robot needed to navigate to the wooden cabinet containing the target bowl.

2. **Open the drawer:** The robot had to open the top drawer to access the bowl.

3. **Grasp the bowl:**  The robot needed to precisely grasp the black bowl within the drawer.

4. **Lift and withdraw the bowl:** The robot needed to lift the bowl out of the drawer and clear the cabinet.

5. **Move to the plate:** The robot needed to transport the bowl to the plateâ€™s location.

6. **Place the bowl on the plate:** The robot needed to carefully place the bowl onto the plate.


**High-Level Movements:**

* **Approach the cabinet:** Steps 0-3.  This movement was necessary to bring the robot into a position where it could interact with the cabinet. The robot needed to move to the right position in front of the cabinet to interact with the drawer.

* **Open the drawer:** Steps 4-7. This movement involved moving the robotic arm down to reach the drawer handle and manipulating it to open the drawer.

* **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 7-9.  This involved positioning the gripper over the bowl and closing it to secure a grasp.

* **Lift and withdraw the bowl:** Steps 10-12. This involved lifting the bowl out of the drawer.

* **Move to the plate:** Steps 12-15.  This involved moving the robot arm to the location of the plate on the floor.

* **Place the bowl on the plate:** Steps 16-18. This final movement involved lowering the bowl onto the plate and releasing the grip.
