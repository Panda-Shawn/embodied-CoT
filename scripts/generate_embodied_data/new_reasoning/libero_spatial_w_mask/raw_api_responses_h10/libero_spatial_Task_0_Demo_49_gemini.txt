## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved manipulating objects on a surface to relocate a specific item. The primary activity was to pick up a black bowl located between a plate and a ramekin and place it onto the plate. The objects involved were a black bowl, a plate, a ramekin, a wooden cabinet (irrelevant to the task), and a flat stove (irrelevant to the task).  The black bowl was positioned between the plate and the ramekin.  The general sequence of high-level movements necessary to achieve the goal was:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needed to navigate to the general vicinity of the black bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot had to position its gripper accurately above the bowl and grasp it securely.
3. **Lift the bowl:** The robot had to lift the bowl vertically to clear the surface.
4. **Transport the bowl:** The robot had to move the bowl to the plate.
5. **Place the bowl:** The robot had to precisely position the bowl on top of the plate and release it.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:


| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the bowl | 0-3 |  To get close enough to the bowl to manipulate it. The robot needed to avoid obstacles and position itself for the grasp. |
| Grasp the bowl | 4-7 | This involved precise positioning over the bowl and then closing the gripper to secure the grasp.  |
| Lift the bowl | 8-12 | To lift the bowl clear of the table surface to avoid collisions during transport. |
| Transport the bowl to the plate | 13-14 | Moving the bowl towards its destination â€“ the plate.   |
| Place the bowl | 15-19 | Precise positioning above the plate, followed by releasing the bowl. |
