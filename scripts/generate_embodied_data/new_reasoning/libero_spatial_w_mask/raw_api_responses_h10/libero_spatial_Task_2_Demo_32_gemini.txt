## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved moving a black bowl from its initial position in the center of a table to a plate located nearby.  The environment included several objects: a black bowl (target object), a plate (destination), cookies, a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, a wooden cabinet (near the plate), and a flat stove (on the table). The bowl was initially on the table in the center, and the plate was also on the table. The goal was to pick up the black bowl and place it onto the plate.  The high-level movements necessary for achieving this goal were:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needs to move its arm to a position above the bowl to prepare for grasping. This involved navigating around other objects on the table, such as the cookies, ramekin, and stove.  (Steps 1-4)

2. **Grasp the bowl:** Once positioned, the robot must lower its arm and close its gripper to securely hold the bowl. (Steps 4-7)

3. **Lift the bowl:** After grasping, the robot needs to lift the bowl to a safe height, ensuring it doesn't collide with the table or other objects. (Steps 8-10)

4. **Move the bowl to the plate:** The robot must carefully move the grasped bowl to a position above the plate. Again, obstacle avoidance around the wooden cabinet is crucial. (Steps 10-13)

5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** The robot needs to lower the bowl onto the plate and release it, ensuring it's placed gently to avoid dropping or damaging it. (Steps 13-17)
