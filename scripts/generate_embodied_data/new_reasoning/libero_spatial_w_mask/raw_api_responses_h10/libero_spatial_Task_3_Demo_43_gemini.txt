## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl situated on a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  The environment contained several objects: a black bowl (on a cookie box), a plate (on the wooden floor), a flat stove, a wooden cabinet, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, all situated on the wooden floor. The primary activity was a two-stage process: grasping the bowl and then transferring it to the plate. This required precise manipulation of the robotic arm to navigate around other objects on the floor. The general sequence of high-level movements was:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** The robot needed to maneuver to the cookie box, position itself correctly above the bowl, and then grasp the bowl using its gripper.
2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl:** Once the bowl was grasped, the robot needed to lift it, move it clear of the cookie box, and transport it to the location of the plate.
3. **Place the Bowl on the Plate:**  After moving to the plate, the robot needed to carefully position the bowl over the plate and release it.

High-level movements and their corresponding trajectory steps:


| High-Level Movement           | Step Range | Justification                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach and Grasp the Bowl   | 0-5        | This involves navigating to the cookie box and acquiring a stable grasp on the bowl. |
| Lift and Transport the Bowl    | 6-10       | This section covers lifting the bowl, maneuvering around obstacles, and moving towards the plate. |
| Place the Bowl on the Plate   | 11-18      | The robot positions the bowl and releases it onto the plate.                           |
| Termination                  | 19         | The robot stops after completing the task.                                          |
