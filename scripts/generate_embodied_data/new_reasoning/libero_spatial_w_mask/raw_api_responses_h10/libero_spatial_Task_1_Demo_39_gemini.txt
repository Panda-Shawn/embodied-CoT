1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included several other objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a flat stove, and another bowl on a table.  These objects were irrelevant to the task but present in the robot's field of view. The plate was on the floor. The primary activity was a two-part manipulation: grasping the black bowl and then transferring it to the plate. The intended outcome was the successful placement of the black bowl on the plate.

The high-level movements identified are:

1. **Approach and Grasp the Bowl:** This movement spans steps 0-6. Justification: The robot needs to position itself correctly to reach the bowl and grasp it.  This involves maneuvering around other objects in the environment to reach the target.
2. **Lift and Transport the Bowl:** This movement spans steps 7-12. Justification: The robot must lift the bowl from the table, maintain its grip, and move it towards the target plate.
3. **Position and Place the Bowl:** This movement spans steps 13-17. Justification: The robot needs to maneuver the bowl above the plate and delicately place it down.
4. **Retreat:** This movement spans steps 18-19. Justification: The robot moves away from the plate to avoid collision.
