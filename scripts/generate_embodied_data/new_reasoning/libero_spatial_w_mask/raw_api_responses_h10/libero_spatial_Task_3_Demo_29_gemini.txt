## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a black bowl from atop a cookie box to a plate located on the floor.  The environment contains several other objects: a flat stove, a wooden cabinet, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, all on the wooden floor. The robot must navigate around these objects to successfully complete the task. The primary activity is a pick-and-place operation; the intended outcome is the black bowl resting on the plate.

The high-level movements identified from the trajectory are:

1. **Approach the cookie box:** (Steps 0-3) This movement is necessary to bring the robot arm into a position where it can grasp the bowl.  The robot needs to navigate the space to reach the cookie box while avoiding obstacles.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** (Steps 4-5)  This involves positioning the gripper above the bowl and closing it to secure the bowl.

3. **Lift the bowl:** (Steps 6-8) This movement lifts the bowl from the cookie box, clearing the obstacle.

4. **Move to the plate:** (Steps 9-11)  This movement transports the bowl to the target location, again navigating around obstacles.

5. **Place the bowl:** (Steps 12-15) This involves positioning the bowl above the plate, opening the gripper to release the bowl, and then retracting the arm.
