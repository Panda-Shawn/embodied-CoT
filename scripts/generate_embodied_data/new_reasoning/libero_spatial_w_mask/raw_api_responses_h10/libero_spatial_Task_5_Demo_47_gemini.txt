1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to move a black bowl, located on a ramekin, to a plate. Both the ramekin with the bowl and the plate are situated on a table, alongside a wooden cabinet and a stove. The robot needs to navigate to the bowl, grasp it without disturbing the ramekin, lift it carefully, move it to the plate, and place it gently on the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involves:

1. **Approaching the bowl:** Moving the robotic arm to a position above the bowl, preparing for grasping. (Steps 0-4)
2. **Grasping the bowl:** Carefully closing the gripper around the bowl. (Steps 5-7)
3. **Lifting the bowl:** Lifting the bowl from the ramekin. (Steps 8-12)
4. **Moving to the plate:**  Transporting the bowl to the plate's vicinity. (Steps 13-14)
5. **Placing the bowl:** Precisely placing the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 15-18)
6. **Retreating:** Moving away from the plate. (Steps 19-24)
