## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task is to pick up a black bowl located on the stove and place it on a plate located on the floor. The environment contains several distractor objects: a wooden cabinet with drawers, a porcelain ramekin, and cookies on a table. The robot must selectively interact with the bowl and the plate, ignoring the other objects.

The robot likely followed this high-level plan:

1. **Approach the stove:** This involves navigating the robot arm to a position where it can reach the black bowl on the stove.  (Steps 0-3)
2. **Grasp the black bowl:** The robot needs to position its gripper over the bowl and securely grasp it. (Steps 4-6)
3. **Lift the black bowl:**  The robot needs to lift the bowl from the stove without disturbing it. (Steps 7-10)
4. **Navigate to the plate:** The robot arm needs to maneuver to a position above the plate on the floor. (Steps 11-18)
5. **Place the black bowl:** The robot needs to position the bowl on the plate. (Steps 19-20)
6. **Release the black bowl:**  The robot needs to open the gripper to release the bowl onto the plate. (Steps 21-22)
