## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involves manipulating objects in a workspace to relocate a black bowl.  The primary activity is to pick up a black bowl situated on a ramekin and place it onto a nearby plate. The objects involved are a black bowl, a ramekin (holding the bowl), a plate (the destination), a wooden cabinet, and a flat stove.  The bowl and ramekin are on a surface (table or floor), the plate is nearby, and the cabinet and stove are also in the workspace but not directly involved in the primary manipulation.

The general sequence of high-level movements needed are:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot must move to a position where it can reach the bowl without colliding with other objects.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot needs to position its gripper over the bowl and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift the bowl:**  The robot must lift the bowl, ensuring a stable grip to prevent dropping it.

4. **Transport the bowl:** The robot must move the bowl to the plate, avoiding obstacles.

5. **Place the bowl:** The robot must carefully position the bowl on the plate.

6. **Release the bowl:** The robot must open its gripper to release the bowl onto the plate.

7. **Return to a resting position**:  The robot completes the task and returns to a safe and default state.

High-Level Movements and Step Ranges:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the bowl | 1-4 |  The robot needs to position itself close enough to the bowl for manipulation. Steps 1-4 involve navigating to the approximate location of the bowl. |
| Grasp the bowl | 5-9 | The robot lowers its gripper, orienting itself correctly for grasping and then closes the gripper to secure the bowl. |
| Lift the bowl | 10-15 | The robot lifts the bowl from the ramekin, ensuring a stable grip and maneuvering to clear any potential obstructions. |
| Transport the bowl | 16-21 | The robot carefully carries the bowl to the plate location. |
| Place the bowl | 22-23 | The robot lowers the bowl above the plate to prepare for releasing it. |
| Release the bowl | 24 | The robot opens the gripper to release the bowl. |
| Return to rest | 25-26 | The robot moves to a resting or default position. |
