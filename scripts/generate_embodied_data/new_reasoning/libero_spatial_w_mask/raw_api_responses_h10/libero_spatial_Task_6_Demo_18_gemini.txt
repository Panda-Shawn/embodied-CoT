## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl located next to a cookie box and placing it onto a plate.  The environment included several other objects: a wooden cabinet, a flat stove, and a glazed rim porcelain ramekin, but these were not directly involved in the task. The primary activity was a manipulation task requiring precise movements of a robotic arm. The intended outcome was the successful transfer of the black bowl from its initial position to the plate.


The general sequence of high-level movements can be broken down as follows:

| High-Level Movement | Step Range | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Approach the black bowl | 0-4 | The robot needs to get close enough to the bowl to grasp it. This involves navigating to the bowl's general location and adjusting its orientation.  |
| Grasp the black bowl | 4-6 |  The robot needs to securely grip the bowl to lift it. This includes positioning the gripper correctly and closing it around the bowl.  |
| Lift the black bowl | 7-9 | The robot needs to raise the bowl to a height that allows for easy transportation to the plate without obstruction. |
| Move to the plate | 9-11 | The robot needs to transport the bowl to the location of the plate. This involves navigating around potential obstacles. |
| Position above the plate | 11-12 | The robot must position the bowl directly above the plate to avoid dropping it or placing it incorrectly. |
| Place the black bowl | 12-15 | The robot must carefully release the bowl onto the plate. |
| Retract | 15-16 | The robot needs to move its arm away from the plate once the bowl has been successfully placed.  |
