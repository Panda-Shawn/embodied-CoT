## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved retrieving a black bowl from a stove and placing it on a nearby plate.  The environment included a stove with a black bowl on it, a plate with cookies, a ramekin, and a wooden cabinet. The primary activity was manipulation of the black bowl, and the intended outcome was its successful transfer from the stove to the plate.  The general sequence of high-level movements involved approaching the bowl, grasping it, lifting it, moving it to the plate, and placing it on the plate.


High-level movements:

1. **Approach the bowl:** Steps 0-5.  This was necessary to position the robotic arm within reach of the bowl.
2. **Grasp the bowl:** Steps 3-5.  This involved closing the gripper around the bowl to secure it for transport.
3. **Lift the bowl:** Steps 6-7. This elevated the bowl to clear the stovetop.
4. **Move the bowl to the plate:** Steps 8-14.  This transported the bowl to the vicinity of the plate.  This included some minor adjustments to navigate to the desired location.
5. **Place the bowl on the plate:** Steps 14-17. This involved lowering and releasing the bowl onto the plate.
