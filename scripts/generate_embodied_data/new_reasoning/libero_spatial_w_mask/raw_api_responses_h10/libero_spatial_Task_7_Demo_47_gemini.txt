## Task Description and High-Level Movements

The task involved picking up a black bowl situated on a stove and placing it onto a plate located on the floor.  The environment included a stove with the black bowl on it, a plate on the floor, a wooden cabinet with drawers, a ramekin, and the stove itself. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to accomplish the task. The general sequence of high-level movements required were:

1. **Approach the bowl:** The robot needs to move to a position above the bowl on the stove.  This involves navigating around other objects like the cabinet.

2. **Grasp the bowl:** The robot needs to lower itself, close its gripper around the bowl, and securely grasp it.

3. **Lift and transport the bowl:**  The robot needs to lift the bowl, maintaining a stable grip, and move it to the vicinity of the plate. This requires careful maneuverability to avoid collisions.

4. **Place the bowl:**  The robot needs to lower the bowl onto the plate. This involves precise positioning and releasing the bowl.


Here's a breakdown of the high-level movements and their corresponding step ranges:

| High-Level Movement        | Step Range | Justification                                                                     |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Approach the bowl          | 0-3        | To position the robot arm for grasping the bowl, avoiding obstacles.           |
| Grasp the bowl             | 4-6        | To secure the bowl for lifting and transportation.                               |
| Lift and transport the bowl | 7-17       | To move the grasped bowl from the stove to the location of the plate.           |
| Place the bowl             | 18-20      | To release the bowl onto the plate.                                              |
