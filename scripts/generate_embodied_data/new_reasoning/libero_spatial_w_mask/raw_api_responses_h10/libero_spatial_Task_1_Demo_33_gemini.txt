## 1. Task Description and High-Level Movements

The completed task involved picking up a black bowl situated next to a ramekin and placing it onto a plate.  The bowl, ramekin, and plate were located on a surface (floor or table) along with a wooden cabinet and a flat stove. The robot needed to navigate around these objects to successfully grasp the bowl and then move it to the plate.

The high-level movements identified in the trajectory are:

1. **Approach Bowl:** Steps 0-4. The robot needed to initially position itself to reach the bowl without colliding with other objects. This involved navigating around other objects on the surface to get to the bowl.

2. **Grasp Bowl:** Steps 4-7. This involved lowering the gripper to a position that will enable grasping the bowl and closing the gripper around the bowl.

3. **Lift and Transport Bowl:** Steps 7-17. After the bowl is grasped, the robot lifts it up and moves to the plate, carefully avoiding collisions with surrounding objects (cabinet, stove, ramekin).

4. **Place Bowl:** Steps 18-20. This stage involved positioning the bowl above the plate and opening the gripper to release the bowl.

5. **Return to Starting Position:** Steps 20-26. The robot returns to a resting position after successfully placing the bowl, avoiding collisions and resetting its posture.
